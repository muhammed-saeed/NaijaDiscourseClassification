:.START

One day last March, CBS, Sports President Neal Pilson, and Olympic superagent Barry Frank do lunch for Lotos Club here.

Oga Frank tell Oga Pilson sey obodo Oyibo, sey de wan do $290 million or more for di TV gist to di 1994 Winter Olympics for Norway.

CBS oga yarn sey di money wey de sell that price sweet o.

At dat price, na only im dey di table when international Olympic Committee start for Toronto Aug. 23.

Dick Pound wey be one committee member start to dey fall hand say a, and NBC no gree even contest.

E con ask Oga Pilson make e raise im offer anyhow say if we get number wey start with three, you fit get dea.

Mr. Pilson, and im team mash for one hallway, come carry only 10 minutes go return with 300 million naira offer.

Mr. Pound con reply, na deal, na beam, Mr. Pilson announce im last coup for one news conference dat afternoon.

Mr. Pilson rival for ABC, and NBC, na dem price di money.

How dem go take push Blessing enter outside?

Well, CBS wey dey inside ratings cellar, and dey look sport as way out, na im wan close di deal kpata-kpata so dat deir rivals go get anoda chance to contest.

But Mr. Pilson don dey put on top one kind ozigi wey dey give sport right, wey be sey de bin suspense am.

De don increase price of poker, crows M. Neinas, College Football Association executive director.

Wit CBS inc, on top of one spending spree wey over cost $2.5 billion for four years of sport, di new bout of hyperinflation fit joll di whole broadcast business.

CBS sef fit lose small hundred million dollars on top four years different sport if di big gamble wey dey di sport dey wrong.

Abc, one unit of capital city, and general electric co, National Broadcasting Co, also risk of loss if dem disobey NBC for any oda contract.

While right fee wey dey go up, ad rate no go dey.

Advertisers don dey balk higher price already, sey network dey pay too much for right na im dey warn adman Paul Isacsson wey be Young & Rubicam sey if dey ask advertisers to absorb di money, dem go lose all, but na few wey need sport pass all.

Viewers fit no dey cheer.

Increase of right, right, go lead to even more serious wahala for commercial matter.

At dat time, some sports event go comot for free, for cable, for pay able, wey half of di country TV home no go fit see dem.

CBS don change di rule wey dey bring di old base for sport, dat is, dat is, only network fit gain gain on top am?

Mr. Pilson talk about di ancillatory benefit of positive press, wey be sey de get affiliate station, enthusiastic advertisers, and big audience wey be sey de fit dey watch any oda radio programme wen di game don end.

Di billion dollar question na, how much be di gain?

Some TV people go dey doubt deir materialism, de go argue sey even if de do, de no go offset di multimillion dollar deficit wey be sey CBS don run o, sey as we don see for di 84 years now, Roger Werner wey be sey deir deal fit turn sour if di number no work.

And after three years, for inside sea of red ink, hero go come see demsef with many, many explanation to do.

CBS dey pursue top of di level wey be sey de no dey support affiliate, people, and advertisers, according to Thomas H. Wyman wey be ogbonge chairman for cbc, after Laurence A.Tey wey be sey na 24.9% stake wey de take for di company, sey de lose di entertainment crown, and de need one.

And de don buy one.

For only three big deal, for four years of ball, for Olympic Winter Games for 1992, and 1994, Pilson sell $164 billion.

Dat is over half a billion dollars plus ABEC, and NBC dey willing to pay. After 1992, na two years apart from di two years wey remain for di Winter Olympics for 1994, and di summer games for 1996.)

Now, Oga, Pilson wey be former university basketball player now, wey talk sey good negotiator need to focus, and intellectuals like good athlete now dey face di consequence of im own aggressive behaviour.

Next month, yarnings go begin on top two coveted B.C contract, for di pro and university basketball final.

CBS fit spend anyting wey e carry go keep am.

Di potential bill, more dan $600 million for inside several seasons, 80% jump.

After some month, na CBS university, and pro ball contract come out for renewal, dem fit go close to $100 million naira if dem dey pay, 40% to 50% increase.

Wetin happen to dat two basketball contract go form di next five years of network sport, according by Peter Lund, wey be former Presido for Multimedia Inc. J. William Grimes, wey be presido for ESPN before, na im talk sey na big bid we go carry come dis university, sey we go fit overbid, and di winners go be university, no be network.

No by way, people wey dey advertise.

Mr. Pilson, na one kind small, big spender.

In di mid-1980 AFCON, after a record of three hundred and nine million for 1988, e sniper at rivals say I love Pilson, but na di guy kpako wen be sey na im complain big pass, and dis one na one reason why right dey so high today. Rivals carrp for di principle of Pilson as NBC'S Arthur Watson don already put am.

But di 49 years old Oga God Pilson no be man wey dey ignore di number.

A Yale law school, e start im career for corporate law, den e come dey do years for Metro Media Inc, and William Morris talent agency.

For 1976, e join CBS Sports to head business matter, and five years later e become president.

Oga Pilson talk sey when e don talk some years now, I no talk forever, and I no talk about every property, di market con change, e con add.

And na no be di only big spender, na im go pay record of 401 million for di 1992 summer games, and ESPN, 80% of di Capital City/ABC, go shell out $400 million for di four year ball wey be sey dey play 175 regular season games every year.

Our competitor say we overbid dem.

Who get mind?

Maybe we know wetin di oder guys no dey do, Oga Pilson talk.

Oga Pilson plan bin come out after Oga Tupper take over.

Mr. Pilson remember sey after CBC don do annual meeting for Philadelphia, im and Mr. Teles take 90 minutes travel go New York, and Mr. Pilson use dis extended private talk take outline im ambition.

Mr. Teles, billionaire for hotel, and finance, na just learn di TV business.

After five months, Oga Atkinson take over as baptizim oga, and e no tey afta Pilson do one kind big, big ting for one slip of paper, pack am put for envelope, carry am go give people wey dey do sport.

Den for May 1988, Oga Atkinson come do bold statement to deny rumour sey e fit sell network.

Mr. Pilson give am one, e bid $243 million for rights to di 1992 Winter Olympics for Albertville, France, ABEC and NBC for no bid even $200 million.

Dat time, di war still dey hot.

Di Major Event strategy, Oga Pilson talk sey dem wan do place for CBS for di crowded TV dial wey dey di 1990s.

It's also a koko for one ailing image.

E dey see flashing of sport as di only way wey be sey network dey cut through cable, and VCR, e dey grab millions of new viewers, dey tell dem about oder shows wey dey happen after some weeks.

Next October, CBS, for di first time, na im go start season against di plenty, plenty American, and national baseball league championships and World Series.

E don tay wey I dey struggle against dat one, na im Jonathan Rodgers wey dey run WBMTV, di CBS owned station for Chicago, don dey yarn.

Even if na ball we lose for NBC, and im no tink sey na ball na im go play pass for NBC and ABC na im e dey talk.

Dat one no surprise.

Regular TV series wey don dey slump for di past five years, and premiering new show na " crap shoot", Oga Pilson talk.

But on top of di sports event, na strong bet to lure audiences 30%, or 40% wey big pass dose B.C.E.

Mr. Pilson talk sey ball, and oda oda ball, na im dey help CBS move go No. 2 for di house wey dey listin, dey put izazz back inside network image.

And di winter Olympic go resume for di February sweep wen de say de go set local station de go put.

Dat one go be one grumpy affiliate again oda Pilson plan.

De go dey find di dream season for 1990.

CBS go dey air di Super Bowl, go dey do basketball, go dey do university, go dey do pro basketball final, and all di Premier League event, na im don make me more committed to CBS," Philip A. Jones, wey be di president of Meredith Corp, wey get two CBS affiliate.

CBS don plan to use big time sports take do platform for oder series wey no go make sense at all.

No amount of hype go carry viewers back if di show no weak, for dis market of 40 channel, sophisticated viewers, remote control, trial no be guarantee of anytin, ESPN'S tori person, Werner talk sey if di show no kill person, de don go.

For di 1984 summer games, afta dem do one call to glory, but di military drama dey miss within weeks.

Last October, during di 1988 summer games, NBC relentlessly pitched one new series wey dem dey call Tager, e be like sey na taya, e be like sey na one kind taya.

And sport no be di only way wey we fit take catch adult women.

Though CBS fit move up to No. 2 for dia house rating, most advertisers dey buy base on ratings for women wey be 18 to 49.

CBS fit still dey small small No. 3 for dat one.

CBS fit dey yab you if you dey go check your nugget.

For recent years now, World Series and Olympics dey show against CBS last position lineup.

But NBC go put di athletes against Bill Cosby, and oder shows for NBC No. 1 schedule.

Even di one wey be sey branch office no dey too talk.

Di sports category fit include only 1% to 5% on top station annual profit.

By na only one station from dumping bc show sey di world series, seven nights no do anytin, na im Arnold Klinsky of wECTV for Rochester, wey drop CBS for three weeks now, na you go judge where network go dey in three years.

Di intangible benefit na im dey very expensive if CBS no fit avoid big loss for di sports coverage itself.

And if we no do like dat, we go do one big work.

On top di $1.06 billion football agreement alone, CBS go lose $250 million in four years, according to Mr. Wussler wey be di former CBS man, na Comsat Inc e dey now, but e dey view di deal as "plain smart" for di big promotional value.

Oga Pilson talk sey dis one wey de lose say very inaccurate, na only sey CBS go lose money for ball for di first year o, sey na too early e go tell wetin go happen after dat one.

But Oga Ater die inside all four years for di contract, e tell U.S. senator last June.

CBS go dey pay di average of $82 million a year pass ABEC, and NBC for collabo, and di two network go dey expect say ball no go dey dis season again.

But CBS go only dey do 12 regular season play, 26 wey be say na only a b c, and na only a b c.

Dat one don provoke some fans.

E still dey drop $50 million for ad-... sale for regular season games, a risk CBS carry am take get unprecedented lock on all playoff games.

If qualifier go end for four game, loss fit make am.

Advertisers dey shalenge higher price wey go help dem close gap.

CBS don sign General Motor and Toyota say na only dem go dey do car repair for four years.

Rice na $265 million.

But ad-... ad-... ad-... ad-... ad-... ad-... ad-... ad-... for di World Series through 1993, 17% less dan wetin dey on top di series dis month.

Further, ad-... ad rate go come down well, well from di GM Toyota price, according by Arnold Chout of Bozell Inc. Other admen, dem say rate fit increase after you increase.

Winter Games outlook too dey mixed.

CBS want make person know where e suppose do reach, but rivals dey argue sey e go beat.

Abbc lose $75 million for 1988 Winter Games, partly because of di $309 million wey dem dey sell am.

Di film na 94.5 hour most of the time wey dem do for Calgary na im dey give di rating small from 1984 but e still fail to deliver di audience wey dem promise to advertise.

CBS go add 25 1/2 hours to dat load for 1992, and na live condition fit make am suffer.

All primetime television go dey on top of di tape dey because of time difference for Norway sotay di result go dey for di 6 o'clock news, (Turner Broadcasting go pay pay for $25 million to take 50 hours of CBS coverage plus 50 hours of additional events).

Barry Frank wey be di agent wey carry Mr. Pilson go lunch last March, na im talk sey even if e lose, say, $10 million, e no reach ten million ain't jack, jack, na three billion naira for inside bank, na im e be ogbonge cash reserve wey be sey de dey sell different, different business o.

Aside sef, sports don get place wey be sey na guaranteed ratings geter, na im David J. Stern wey be di commissioner for National Basketball Association talk sey dis one no be free situation o, sey dis one na case of careful business people wey dey judge matter well, well.

Dat one dey easy for am to talk na: CBS don do four years pact now for $176 million for four years o, by di time wey im dey talk to Oga God, Pilson don complete for di month.

Dat one go reduce EFCC small margin for profit, and error.

CBS don collect $50 million or so last year.

And bc dey take di least money in prime time, na bc, and nbc dey pay 30% to 35% for advert according to one Variety study.

But CBS dey big, and risk dey follow every new sports package wey CBS lock up.

Although sports officials dey predict increase of 50% to 100% on top major contract wey dey come for renewal, ad rate may increase only 20%.

CBS dey hope to save money if de order no go dey for di regular series because dey go fill weeks of prime time.

But di savings go be small.

Every hour of olympic and ball wey dey prime time, na im go cost CBS $2.6 million to $2.8 million, one hour drama wey be only $900,000 and na times two dem dey sell am.

CBS fit get like $200 million a year in interest on top di money wey dem dey sell CBS Records, plus di rest of di business.

But media analyst, Richard J. Macdonald of Macdonald Grippo Riely talk sey wall street no go gree gree to dat one o, sey on top one stand, network suppose dey make money on top am.

When dem ask Oga Pilson directly, you go fit make money on top all dis one? e no just say yes o, wetin you really dey ask, na di profit, and loss wey you suppose get for management, e dey talk.

E con answer im own question ehen.

Na di only question we need to address.
