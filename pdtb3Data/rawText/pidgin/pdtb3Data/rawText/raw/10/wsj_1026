COCOA: Dis no be di normal sell-off wey we do on Tuesday.

Di December contract end for $999 metric ton, down $15.

Di market dey drift at least partly because of lack of crop information for Ghana, Ivory Coast, di two biggest African producers.

Harry Schwartz wey be soft commodity specialist for Cargill Investors Service for New York, yarn sey di only report wey be sey Ghana don bring cocoa enter inside house, na 7,839 metric tons as of Oct.

(By dis time last year, e don record 33,270 tons) afta e don announce am.

E be like sey na di same kain situation wey dey happen for Ivory Coast be sey no number dey reach dis year o, compare to 55,000 tons wey dey dis year since last year.

E say if small cocoa actually reach port, shipping delay fit happen.

Na di worry be sey maybe na di wahala wey dey happen for market earlier for di week, na im e say.

De still fear sey without Ivory Coast cocoa, one big French cocoa business man, Cie, dey dere.

Financiere Et denres no go fit deliver cocoa against di contract wey dem first sell for London for December.

But, French business man don get about 200,000 tons of old Ivory Coast cocoa for Netherlands from one agreement wey e don make with di Ivory Coast last spring.

Cargill tink sey even dough di business man get contract wey talk sey e no go carry dis cocoa go market till March 1991, some evidence wey dey inside di contract don change.

Dis proposal, e fit be sey na French merchant go carry dis cocoa if necessary against di short position wey dey dere.
