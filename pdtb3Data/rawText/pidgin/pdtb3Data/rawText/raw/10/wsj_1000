Di move na im big pass for di new outcry against programme wey dey sell, with Kemper put di money, di millions dollars wey dey inside commission wey dey generate every year for where im mouth dey.

Di Kemper Corp. Union and oda goment come dey para sey dis one wey be sey dey sell, na im dey cause wildaness wey be sey na on top Tuesday, October 13, and 16 e dey increase chance wey be sey market crash don happen.

For di past nine months, some company like, Charles Schwab & Co, Sears, Roebuck & Co, Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Dem don come outside dey do business as major market.

After 1987 crash na im some big bank banks come stop to dey buy securities.

But most of dem, na Morgan Stanley & Co na im dey lead dem since last year.

Di one wey dey worse pass na di one wey dey market, di one wey dey sell, di one wey dey sell, di one wey dem dey sell with di one wey dem dey sell with di one wey dem dey sell with di one wey dem dey sell with di one wey dem dey sell with di one wey dem dey sell with di one wey dem dey sell with di one wey dem dey sell with di one wey dey market.

Di object na to collect money from rupee, rupee, and rupee.

Inbuilt arbitrage recently, na about half of all programme wey dey sell for New York Stock Exchange.

Last month, na 20.9 million dem dey sell for one day, or 138% of di Big Board average daily volume.

On Tuesday afternoon, Kemper tell di Bear, Stearns & Co, General Electric Co, peabody & Co, unit, Morgan Stanley, Openheimer & Co, sey e no go dey do anyhow wit dem because of sey de dey go index arbitrate, officials inside and outside dey confirm.

Kemper oga dem no gree identify di firms, but dem agri to go on top four securities firm, come talk sey di list of oga patapata no go do business o, in di months ahead.

We don dey against di index arbitrage wey be sey e don tay wey Stephen B. Timbers, di chief investment officer for Kemper wey be sey e dey manage $56 billion, plus $8 billion of stocks.Index Arbitration no dey work, and e dey scare natural buyers of stock.

While Mr. Timbers explain sey not fully convinced index dey change di level of stock market, e say on top of intraday basis, e get major effect.

We don talk to proponents of index arbitrage, con tell dem sey make dem cool am because de dey spoil market.

De say toh bad, naim we come finally say we no go business wit dem.

Kemper also blasted di Big Board for taking away di interest of individual and institutional holder, di New York Stock Exchange don put on top big member securities firm (dat cloud objectivity), Mr. Timbers talk sey di thing never dey interested for wetin we tink.

Di Big Board too get bad communication problem with individual investors ehn.

Small investors perceive sey big operator dey dominate market, Thomas O'Hara, di chairman of National Association of Investors, and di chairman of di Independent Investors Advisory Committee, after di 1987 crash, di impression wey I don get be sey de go like comot am with program trading, but de, di exchange no go fit do am.

E say di market matter dey worry am, but all di exchange fit do na to calm down di process wit circuit breakers, and shock absorber.

Mr. Timbers counter say di only thing wey de put in circuit breakers na admission of deir problem.

Morgan Stanley and Kidder Peabody, di two biggest programme wey dem dey do, stand up for dia strategy o, sey we continue to believe di position wey we don take so, sey we go stop index matter wen market dey stress, and we don do am recently, e talk sey na Oct. 13 and earlier dis week.

Michael Carpenter, president and chief executive officer for Kidder Peabody, na inside one new interview o, talk sey we no think sey index matter don affect market as a whole.

According by Lawrence Eckenfelder, one securities analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc, e con talk sey Kemper, na im be di first firm to do major statement on top programme wey be sey de don do only one firm wey be sey dey do dis one no go mean hill of beans.

But if na dis one dey make oder people dey look di same ting, den di ting go come dey very important.
