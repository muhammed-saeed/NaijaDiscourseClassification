Christoph Cox's Oct. 13 editorial page Toward More Crippling Lawsuits.

1989 American With Disabilities Act na to remove discrimination o.

When we look wetin happen for our own history, e clear sey di way we take do am, no be by the goodness of people heart, but na by law, and constitutional amendment.

Dis na how American women go take get right to vote.

And na how African Americans, and oder minority groups take get equal rights as citizen for di country.

For more than 43 million Americans with disability, di 1989 American With Disabilities Act provide di missing piece.

Disable Americans don get dia civil rights guaranteed for all federal government funded programmes since September 504 wey dem pass as part of di 1973 Rehabilitation Act.

1989 act just dey extend dis guarantee to private sector.

People wey dey fear agriment of suits paralyzing our legal system, na only di record on di Rehabilitation Act, dem go just look am.

Without legal recourse, no guarantee of civil rights for anybody.
