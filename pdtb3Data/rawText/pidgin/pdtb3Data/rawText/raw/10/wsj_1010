Wall Street go like UAL Corp. board to change e mind on top sey make di company dey independent.

But wetin go happen next for di continuation of di drama na di two most powerful and fractious unions wey be di pilots and machinists.

Some people wey dey dere now, de believe sey di collapse of di previous six ton79 billion buyout if anything like dat don make di hands of dis two labour groups strong.

Because of dat one, both of dem fit get virtual veto power for any UAL transaction.

One reason be sey bank go likely react to any new UAL sey even if na di first time na im go insist on top labour matter before dem go agree to pay for any new kobo, or even less ambiambiquerious recapitalisation plan.

Federal government don show on top many occasions wey be sey de don ready, and fit strike, na im one of UAL big lender talk sey if you get dem for strike, you no get revenue, and na very scary ting for bank to dey look.

Just last week now, one leading Japanese bank ask for meeting with di machinists union leaders to determine where di union go stand if anoda bid, or recapitalisation start.

Anoder reason be sey as dem succeed to shalenge wetin don happen before, na im make dem dey push macho people to vex if anoda try come out.

Di two union don already get big leverage simply because sey deir employer never fit settle any new contract.

Dat one dey give dem threat of strike, and di ability to resist any money concession wey be sey dem go need to do transaction work.

So even investors wey dey push for di board to do recapitalisation, wey go pay shareholders of special dividend, and maybe na gorry people dem wey be sey deir union dey key, sey no be sey dem dey create, and complete transaction without unions cooperation, and wage concession, na im Richard Nye, of Baker, Nye Investments, one New York company take dey do business.

Oga Nye think sey di UAL board go shutdown if e no move quickly to increase shareholder value.

Both pilot, and machinist don make am clear sey de want stop any transaction wey be sey de no like, pilot go dey inside any transaction wey dey happen around dis side, pilot, Frederick C. Dubinsky don yarn yesterday.

But weda di pilot fit follow deir long run enemy, na another kweshon.

Di pilot wey be Oga Dubinsky talk sey di union go like get most of im people wey be sey na dem get am.

At di least, di pilots wan form of control for di airline maybe through supermajority vote right.

No be sey people wey be macho person dey always vex for most owner in principle say dem no dey consider employee to be owner.

Still, in recent times, machinists union leaders don show sey dem get new flexibility, sey we fit reach trade comot wey be sey we dey accommodate di pilot union concerns, and our own na Brian M. Freeman, di machinists financial adviser.

Mr. Freeman say di machinists union advisers go come dis week to try to get blueprint for some kind of recapitalisation wey fit include special dividend for shareholders, employees, and maybe an equity investment by a friendly investor.

If dem no fit compromise, di pilots go maintain demsef if no machin person support dem.

But at dis point, na just wishful thinking.

Di machinist dem lobbie well, well against di original bid wey UAL pilot, and management for di company dey give.

Opposition from dem help some Japan bank.

Di pilot wey be sey na majority of dem get am also, fit make di idea of recapitalisation hard to achieve, sey who wan be public shareholder for di company wey be sey na di pilots union dey control, ask Candace Browning wey be analyst for value, Schroeder & Co, sey which board go dey work for, public shareholders, or pilots?

Ms. Browning talk sey na only when di pilot relent on top of dia demand for control, na im e go take succeed.

She also note sey even if pilots gree take minority stake now, de still fit come back later, and try take control.

Anoder possibility na for di pilots to approach anoda investor through di solicitation of consent.

Dat be sey di pilots go fit force di board to approve recapitalisation wey go give people wey dey work, to consider di new proposal wey di labour organisation dey propose.

Di group no do formal offer, instead, dem tell UAL advisers before most reasonable board meeting sey na bid wey be sey dey between $225, $240 a share.

But again, na Malay pesin fit help dem.

I think di dynamics of dis situation be sey sometin don happen ‚Äù na so one official for di situation talk.

Board and UAL management, e say e no fit go back to business as usual o, pilot no go let dem.
