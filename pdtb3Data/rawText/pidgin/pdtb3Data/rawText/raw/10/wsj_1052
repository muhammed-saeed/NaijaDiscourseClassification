Di bad news for junk bond market yesterday na sey TW Services, one group of restaurant chain don become di latest koko wey dey come out from bondage to bond bond.

Di good news wey dey reach people wey dey hold steady credit, at least, na im di rejection dey talk about bad mind wey people wey be junk buyer get.

Apparently dem dey learn say no be to dey too risk.

Koniston Partners (wey be sey de dey control 80% of TW) don dey plan to sell $1.15 billion for junk bond, plus other tings wey be sey de go take deir remaining public share.

But Coniston, one New York partnership wey be sey dey manage by di firm of Gollust, Tierney & Oliver na yesterday e come yarn sey as e dey for securities market, dem go postpone am, come arrange am again.

Wetin no dey dere be sey Coniston, and im investment banker, Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette just complete two weeks road show to take dey advertise di bond.

And investors, at least for now, con do pass.

Dna ni o, ni o, ni o, ni o!

E get fast food restaurant, including Denny's, Hardee, Quincy's and El Pollo Loco (di only major fast food chain wey be sey de dey specialize for char-... chicken), e dey stable, dey hard, dey grow well, well.

But except de grow, TW wey dey Paramus, N.J., de go run enter trouble.

Before now, such buy now, pray for growth laters na routine, but people no dey buy am on expectation again Jack Utter wey dey manage di highyield fund of IDS financial affairs, e add am sey e dey get religion, di TW buy out, dem go still fund am sey nothing do di company o.

Di rubi, e dey talk sey di junk market no dey deep like dat before.

Dem postpone di stockholder meeting from tomorrow to November 21.

By dis time, DLJ want be able to sell small junky bond.

Gollust, Tierney & Oliver likely to contribute more dan $120 million for di equity plan.

Banks fit add oda bank account join.

And di total numo no go dey again.

ADL banker wey put aproko on top am, talk sey very few people sey dem no like di credit.

People talk sey de no tink am sey di billion dollar deal go trade.

But na credit be di tin wey dey buy pesin own.

And by adding equity, DLJ go dey acknowledge sey credit risk na big tin.

True, true, di DLJ banker dey yarn sey for di reborn capital structure, cash exchange of interest, e go try well, well, as e con talk am sey we dey listen to market.

Wetin be di tin wey be sey you go borrow term for Conion so wey be sey di market no go dey again?

Some of di same risk wey de mention, and e be like sey de ignore dem for many before, before junk offering.

TW prospectus dey yarn sey if to say dem do am earlier, before tax go come, dem go add am money, plus interest on top debt, by about $62.7 million for di first six months of 1989.

TW note, as many of dis junk issue dey do sey Ajusted to eliminate non-cash charges, TW for get cash surplus, in dis case, of $56 million over six months.

But dat kind calculation, no be sey de dey pay di non-cash charge of dereciation, to allow small, small wear of French frider, katakata of shops, and all di rest.

In fact, DLJ dey yarn sey di company dey envision capital expenditure of about 80 million a year.

We dey pitch be sey deir sales, and deir restaurant don dey increase well, well, and people no go stop to dey eat during downturn.

But de no go chop for Denny own.

Fast food business na "intensely competition", na im Schroder analyst John Rohr talk.

Eyewitness wey dey buy TW, don see sey e don dey enjoy because e don dey use plenty time dey build restaurant, dey buy redo.

We dey worry sey dem no go generate enough cash take capitalism, and sey dem go still pay down, sey one big investor for high level, na im dey yarn o.

DDLJ argue sey TW fit, if necessary, cut capital expenditure, sey half of wetin dem wan spend na for growth, no be for maintenance.

But people wey dey invest say under di shelved offering, TW for need to grow grow to meet di money wey be sey de dey borrow.

If to say you dey collect money, de go dey collect five2 million a year on top interest, or zerocoupon debentures (wey go mean to pay) on top cash matter.

Di prospectus talk sey no assurance now sey future growth go continue for di level wey dey before.

For di past, bond buyers no find like dat again.

Now e be like sey de dey do.
