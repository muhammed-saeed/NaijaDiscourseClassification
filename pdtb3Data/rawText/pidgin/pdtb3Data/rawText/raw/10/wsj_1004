International Business Corp, don yarn sey e don gree make Motorola Inc take part for one of dia doubol research project as part of wetin dey help U.S. semiconductor industry.

IBM wey talk for di dedication of one research centre, talk am, e con invite many oder companies dem including some ones from Europe, to do wetin dem dey do.

Jack Kuehler wey be IBM president, e con talk sey im dey even reason sey im too dey let oder company dem do additional work, but e no get any more specific details.

IBM wey talk sey one year ago, e don dey invite companies to take do some kind of thing wey be sey dey do some kind of IBM, as e don try to rally U.S. industry make dem come take over di Japanese market for dynamic random memory chips.

While IBM, Armonk, N.Y. dey do di bulk of di DRAM wey dey use am, e no dey make di equipment need to produce di chips.

And IBM worry sey Japan go take over di equipment market unless U.S. semiconductor company produce enough memory chips here to keep U.S. equipment makers healthy.

Failure of U.S. equipment maker, IBM fear, go comot am o, go depend on many Japanese company wey dey compete with am for oder part of di market.

IBM still yarn sey e dey expect pipo to benefit from di work wey Motorola, and oder company dem fit do to help dem deal on top problem wey be sey dem dey do with semiconductor manufacturing.

IBM don dey do one industry wey dey try to improve one thing wey be sey dem dey call IBM.

IBM talk sey e dey expect sey na industry wey go dey dominate because semiconductor don dey too expensive.

One state of di earth plant cost 40 million in di mid-1970 naira, but na $500 million today because di technology too dey complex.

And IBM say e dey expect make di money continue to climb.

IBM wey talk sey Motorola dey pay just a nominal fee to cover di 21 months agreement, acknowledged sey some company don reduce im invitation to join.

But e say na mostly because sey di project no go produce fruit until mid-1990.

IBM talk sey e go take more company to see as di project take progress.

Di project wey dem dey call Motorola mean wetin dem dey call X-ray lithography, wey be sey e go dey important to future generations of memory chips.

Now, as camera take dey produce image for film, na so photo dey produce image for di chip.

But details on chips must now be extra, and even di amount of light wey dey inside, go too much sotay di juju wey dey dere, go too dey blurred. Di juju fit produce big, small, but e go hard to paint small.

Xray na oyibo oyibo oyibo and e dey easy to travel pass lite.

Xray too get problem too.

Dem fit make di mask bribe, and dem fit pass through material wey de no suppose pass.

But, assuming sey de go fit win all dose wahala, make dem forget chips wey reach one billion naira (di four million chips) wey just dey reach market, and one million times wey dey reach market around di middle of dat 1970.
