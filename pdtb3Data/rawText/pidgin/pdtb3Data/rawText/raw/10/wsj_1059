Till now, dem don put intense competition wey be sey na mostly for computer market, sey digital market na im dem wan take dey do jibiti for network.

But Digital go enter mainframe, go target IBM home turf wey go dey inside di market wey go dey command 70 percent.

Digital, Maynard, Mass, insist yesterday sey di marketing go differ from IBM own sef, sey dis one no be your papa mainframe, sey allan mtschew na Digital spokesman, sey na one, one new generation.

IBM wey be sey de dey collect half of its revenue, plus half of its profit from mainframe, na im dey add new software wey dey use di new hardware dey allow customers to do so-so batch processing as well as 60%.

For example, dem dey call am “ fish processing ” wey be sey na single work data wey dem dey do for computer wey be sey na im dey rush pass for night like to dey check wetin dey happen for bank.

IBM talk sey di 16 new J and JH model go dey available normally though three no go ship reach three quarter of di next year.

Small profit on di big model wey reach like $13 million naira sef, e no go change.

Small, small model wey deir performance grow to 46%, de go bring higher price.

From big, big model sef, na im de go dey price.

Digital na 9000 mainframe wey dem say na from di highest wey dey, dem dey price from $1.2 million to $3.9 million sharper than IBM.

Di first one go ship for di spring with di largest one wey go fall for di next one.

Analysts fall short say Digital no go contribute plenty money before next fiscal year wey begin for July.

Local Digital buyers talk sey di new VAX go allow dem stay wit digital wen dey need di power of mainframe, instead of dem to turn to IBM, sey I dey sure sey big market dey for dis machine o, sey Stephen Smith of PaineWeber Inc.

Digital too dey push demsef to compete with IBM wey be sey na giant customer dey take dey upgrade some tings wey be sey deir business.

Digital, however, no expect to displace IBM mainframe wey don already dey for big companies.

In addition to commercial market, Digital dey target di low end of di engineering, and scientific supercomputer market when dem dey package am with optional supercharger wey dem dey call vector processor.

Digital technology dey come at a time when di mainframes dey under pressure from small computer, and di workstation wey dey operate on standard computer, instead of di one wey old computer dey use.

Digital don enter big position for di booming workstation market, but small size for dat market big pass mainframe.

Small time now, di mainframe market too don show new sign of life.

IBM mainframe sales don do wetin dey better dan dis year o with analysts wey dey estimate say dem don climb from 10% to 12%.

Di official for dis system don dey very, very strong, na im Bill Grabe, di senior IBM marketing executive talk sey we get strong backlog for di four quarter even without di system wey de don announce yesterday.

But di 3090 line na almost five years old wey dey reach mainframe years and wey be sey e go slow down for 1990.

IBM, Armonk, N.Y. dem talk sey e wan bring di mainframe come outside so dat e go spark more sales as per di end of di year.

Di fourth quarter na always IBM biggest by far, with most sales wey dey come December as customers dey try to dey spend money before di year end.

Still, Steve Cohen wey be analyst for SoundView Financial Group Inc, na im talk sey, “I no see sey dis one go give IBM one major kick in di fourth quarter.

IBM don already indicate sey e go get wahala for di quarter, partly because of delay for high end disk drive, and partly because di strong dollar go reduce di money wey im overseas earnings suppose be na dollars.

Some analyst don estimate am sey di fourth quarter per-share earnings go fall from 10% to three,57 a share from three,97 a share a year earlier.

In addition to di new mainframe, and software like dat, IBM don announce one magnetic tape system wey be sey e go dey use half of di floor, and di one wey be sey dey use one single cartridge.

Dat one suppose help IBM to address damage wey one resurrected storage technology corp don inflict for dat market.
