Japan don dey move on top one kind capital matter wey be sey e go make im trade too much even when e dey weak.

Di capitalisation dey increase double number for di second year for row, and di superefficient producer of everyting from car to computer chips dey rush go expand capacity, modernize factory, and develop new product.

Mitsuru Saito, wey be economist for Sanwa Research Institute, e say e dey make you tink of di Golden '60 wen Japan come dey hot well, well.

Di more factories, and robots wey be Japan person dey add, di more de go dey fit export, and di less deir domestic customers go dey import.

For Canon Inc, for example, na almost 20% of wetin dey sell camera, and computer printer dey do wetin any Japan company go do under di circumstances, e dey increase capital expenditure by 60%.

E dey build among oda tings, one new laserbeam printing machine for western Japan wey fit produce up to 150,000 printer next year.

Some of dem must dey exported go U.S.

Even companies wey dey do smokestack dey fight world wide overcapain.

Japan steel company dey raise capital cost of 22% dis year to $4.8 billion.

Hatachi Zosen Corp, wey be shipbuilder wey dem bury for credit, na im go build one machine wey dem dey call tanda, wey go first build for 14 years.

So dis one wey be sey de don do big, big thing wey be sey, de don do big, big thing wey be sey, na Japan go carry di main one wey be sey, na Japan go carry di main one wey be sey, na Japan go carry di main one wey be sey, na Japan go carry di second one wey be sey, na Japan go carry di second one wey be sey, na Japan go carry di second one wey be sey na Japan go carry.

From financial standpoint, di boom no come at a better time.

Many Japanese company dey expect to record profit dis fiscal year, and Japan interest rate, even though sey e don dey reduce small, e still dey low.

And for business wey be sey person wey get limited right, and wey dey expect only small dividend, go fit reduce im profit, put am for plant, and equipment.

But some of dem wey be economist, and government people here, de no dey hail.

Dem dey fear sey di boom wey dey happen fit be big ting for Japan, or any oda good ting, sey na explosive cocktail we skata for di world, na im Kenneth Courtis, senior economist for Tokyo Unit of Deutsche Bank Group, talk am.

Ministry of International Trade and Industry dey so, so na di latest move wey dem just take, na im come make Japan motor take dey do one kind caution for capital spending.

MANY people wey dey work for dem dey try make dem no fall on top U.S., even though sey na Japan soldier dey control all di motor wey dey reach U.S.A.

No be everybody dey worry now.

Some wey be economist, and many Japan company dey wonder sey di warning na wahala.

Sey di investment boom, na mostly because of strong domestic demand, and e no go fit increase export sharp, sharperly.

And many investment no wan dey increase capacity.

According to one survey wey dem do, about 2,400 big company by Japan Development Bank, expansion plan na just 51.8% of di outlays, for only manufacturers, na 32%.

Di manufacturers say fourteen percent of wetin de dey spend na to improve di product, or add new one, 175% na to reduce price, 125% na for research, and development, and di rest na for maintenance, and oder ting.

But di wota nor dey konfuse at-all.

Wit Japan dey do big, big business for di world, de dey reason sey make Japan dey do more for di domestic domestic matter, dey import more.

And Eventually, de go contend, domestic demand go weaken, forcing companies to emphasize export again, sey if de get anoder drive to export, sey Nobuyuki Arai, wey be economist for Japan Development Bank, sey na wahala.

Even short run sef, di investment boom fit add more wahala, Japan export dey show small, small wahala.

For example, Japanese auto maker dey increase im power for U.S., so di additional one wey dey in part, de go replace imported motor wit locally manufactured one.

But even dough Japan company increase deir U.S. auto output by 42% from January to September compared to di year ago, deir export to di U.S. go reduce only 9% dis year, Nikko Research Center estimate.

Contrary to di previous economic boom, Japan motor company no just dey try to boost production.

Many dey pour money into developing high quality to reach affluent consumers, and to some extent, to avoid cheap cars from South Korea, and Taiwan.

Others dey replace old facilities wit flexible assembly line wey go dey bring different types of oda models at once.

So many companies dey invest inside high tech machine wey be sey Fanuc Ltd too, one robot too go build new plant.

Di buildup dey make Japan more efficient, more technological advanced, more competitive, according to one Western Diploma for Tokyo.

But any how e dey affect export, and import matter, na so Japan investment don dey boost di economy since two years, at least, na di high growth of domestic demand dey boost am.

Japan marathon economy dey grow at four3% dis year now for di 35th month expansion, and some economists dey beg sey di boom go take over di record 57 months expansion for di last 60 years.

Japanese consumers dey more eager to spend money, especially on top high price items like 29inch television set, and luxury cars.

NISsan Motor Co, dem dey sell cars up to 20% dis year mostly because of di expensive Cima, Sylvia, and Cephiro model.

One dealer tell me sey if e get more motor, e go sell am sharp, sharp, sey Takkuro Endo, na Nissan executive vice president o.

E add sey di company dey try to increase demand by overworking its employees.

Similarly, Honda Motor Co, deir sales na so risk wey workers dey para sey de never do Saturday for some years despite government supplication of more leisure activity.

Wit demand, growth, and short supply, many Japanese go don dey use plenty, plenty automation.

Some of dem na men wey dey build ship (wey don plan to repair ship for many years naw), wey plan to reduce cost wen e bi sey di ship don dey weak, but naw, di market don dey strong well-well.

Sasebo Heavy Industries Co, one big shipbuilder na im dey expect make di market increase for dis year, mostly because of di high demand for oil tankers.

Once one Japanese company step up investment, di whole industry dey follow.

Because most business na to dey share evritin wey dey sell, to allow competition get evritin wey e fit get, na to concede defeat.

Di emphasis on market matter dey for Daikin Industries Ltd, di biggest maker of air conditioners for Japan.

Daikin don dey build new office, e don dey grow dey sell so, e don dey build anoder plant wey go produce like 50%.

Di expansion no be only for meeting demand, but na to expand di company market to 30% from 27% wey dey currently.

Apart from dat one, na Hitachi Ltd, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd na im dey add production line, na im one Daikin talk sey before now, we dey try to increase productivity for di facility wey we dey now.

But we no fit produce bele again.

Di competition dey hot for motor industry pass wetin dey happen for world wide market.

Di NISsan attempt to increase di market share to 30% akordin to one plant wey dem plant for southern Japan wey fit produce like 240,000 cars per year.

Meanwhile, Toyota motor corp na $247 million e dey increase every year by 180,000 car, and Honda dey spend $317 million on expansion.

Maada motor corp, di company still dey consider oda option, but e boldly plan to double di total money wey dem dey sell give 800,000 motor for di next four years.

People wey no worry about how Japan manufacturers investment go affect trade, dem talk sey many new, no be replacement for import.

Di import account for less dan 1% of beer wey dey Japan, Asahi Breweris Ltd, wey dey share di popular dry beer, don dey plan to do Japanese oda competition wey be sey dem go pour $106 billion gbangain into di facilities to produce more beer.

But new product development go make Japan company dey stronger, and big investment like beer go make am even harder for foreign competitor to crack di Japanese market.

Also, many of di investment wey be sey de invest only limited foreign competition, so more investment, almost all di more export.

For example, Toshiba Corp dey spend $986 million on top two new plants to build four megabyte dynamic random access, di next generation of computer chips.

Di product no dey widely used yet, but Toshiba wey don already win di whole generation one-megaegadRAMs, dey believe sey di early investment go make am possible again to win di competition again, e dey important to win leadership.

Meanwhile, Toshiba, Japan rival, Hitachi, Fujitsu Ltd, and NEC Corp, no still dey sit down.

After one plant don produce two million, NEC don dey spend $275 million to build anoda plant wey in two years go fit produce one million, four million DRAM for one year.

Hajime Sasaki wey be NEC vice president talk sey we get enough product to make, and market to sell dis product.

Some of Japan prophecy wey be sey because of di investment boom, e don get head for overseas.

Toyota own na three five Lexus motor, one luxury car wey start to dey carry go U.S. only last month, na im dey put fire for di market wey U.S. madam dey sell for market.

Toyota get mind say e go raise Lexus when new plant just begin grow next year.

What if di way dem dey sell am dey weak one day?

Japanese company get caveat competitor attitude.

If excess power develop, de say no be everybody go suffer.

Di losers go be di ones wey get di least belle, and many of dem, analysts go think sey dem be foreign company.
