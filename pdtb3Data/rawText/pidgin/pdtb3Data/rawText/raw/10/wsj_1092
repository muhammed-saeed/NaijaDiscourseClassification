Dis one na for response to Atsushi Kageyama's manager journal, looking for real ting in Sony, for Editorial page, Oct.

Though I gree wit many of Oga, Kageyama yarn, I believe sey e dey point di gun for di wrong direction, no be Americans de criticise am for sey dem no sabi di Japanese culture, but Japan people dey try to force deir culture on Americans.

Japan want make we take deir culture, but dem no gree take American culture.

Japan manager no fit expect Americans to behave like Japan person, instead, de must manage Americans as Americans.

America suppose dey conform to Japan culture when Japan.

Wetin dey worry us sey make Japan people dey do wetin American people dey find for here?

American dey place native, or native speaker wey dey in charge of subsidiary overseas.

European multinationals dey do likewise, American people dey usually run by American managers.

But Japan dey insist on Japanese manager everywhere, dey set up shop.

Japan person dey feel sey e too big wey im sabi manage pass?

Oga Kageyama talk sey Kotobuki electricians no dey understand wetin deir foreign oga dey see.

While Mr. Kageyama dey do one better work of explaining di differences, both cultural and philosophic, I dey question im own perspective.

Abi e go suggest sey make person wey dey work for American company wey dey do business for Japan dey do wetin deir new oga culture, and philosophy dey?

Ehen no!

So di conclusion be sey di load dey on top management to understand, and to understand di culture and philosophy of di country wey dem dey operate.

Work fit dey motivated, and di company fit dey full potential only when management embrace di people wey dey work.

I believe Oga, Kageyama leave one major part for Japan culture wey come from am, di belief in japan culture, and character vs oders.

Manager no suppose to rehearse im staff kweshon about how e dey manage.

Instead, make e listen to wetin de talk wey fit make am do some kind work, as e dey try to do some kind work.

Japannese culture vs.

American culture no dey irrelevant.

Di key na how manager for one culture go take motivate employees from anoder culture.

For Mr. Kageyama wey dey argue sey American employees must only accept direct imposition of di Japan way wey dem dey do tins, na outright cultural chastity of di first order.

Japan dey take over di opportunity to create new corporate culture wey be sey na di best ting wey dey inside both national culture.

Mr. Kageyama correct to deny one anti-American bias.

E go hard more to deny General Oga God, bikos e dey si tins di way Japan dey do.

When critic na to just explain wetin dey for di matter, I dey sure sey Oga, Kageyama never still come out for di root cause of di problem, and na just to treat am.
