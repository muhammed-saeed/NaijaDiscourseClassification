As one presidential candidate for 1980, na so George Bush take paraphrase im position ontop abortion for one interview wey Rolling Stone magazine release dat March.

Wetin e tink of Supreme Court judgement on top abortion matter?

I dey see am say correct, correct, Oga Bush yarn di trut.

After some month, Oga Bush come dey run mate.

At wons, George Bush wey be prochooice advocate con become George Bush di anti-Abortionist.

And di vaccination no end dere.

Just one month ago, Oga Bush con threaten to vex on top one pending welfare bill if e provide any abortion fund, except save di woman's life.

E con reach two weeks now wey de talk sey I no dey find any quarrel on top dis one o, di Presido con say im go consider compromise to fund abortion for poor women in case of rape, and incest.

But only four days after dat one, Oga Bush resurrect di veto threat say I no dey support Federal funding for abortion except where di mama dey risk her life, e don announce and finally con do di measure last Friday.

So wetin George Bush really believe?

Di answer na so murky sey e don begin to dey enter dis popular president inside trouble wit each of di more vocal, more powerful side of di abortion issue.

Di result na lie, lie and insult wey everybody dey talk.

Anti-Abortion force see am as di best a-... a-... if you ask me sey dis man na true believer, I no know o sey na Washington based Adhochoc for Life Insight, but abortion rights still dey critical.

Douglas Gould wey be vice president for communication for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, na im dey yarn dis one on top di abortion fund issue ehn, dey yarn sey di guy never do one tin about prevention.

Im kporo, e kporo!

Oga Bush dey plain wit di oda abortion question.

For most of di nine years wey don pass, e don try deceive people wey dey do anti-American, deir position.

But ever since Supreme Court lay down Webster vs.

Product Health decision dis year change political opinion on top abortion issue, Presido Trump try just as hard as possible to talk more unless dem press di wall.

Many Americans still dey worry deirsef on top abortion matter.

Oga, bush problem no plenty sotay e be like sey e dey vex on top di matter as e be sey e be like sey e no dey too sick.

Di political risk go far o if di Presido draw strong line, come hang for top, expert sey if you get position, e go better meh you stick wit am instead of you to dey waka anyhow, na di Republic strategist John Sears.

Di need for consistency dey eazy for Oga, dis one wey be sey Oga God Sears dey maintain, e no get strong ideology base.

By im moderate position as president, and di warning of political advisers wey be sey di matter dey important to young voters, e fit be sey di Presido get at least sympathy wit abortion argument.

But e still dey strong for di way e dey talk and swear wen e dey do big-big tins for Oyibo.

For many issues like flag burning, for example, im keen political sensitivities overcome all dis quarrel.

But Mr. Bush and im advisers miscalculate di politics of di abortion issue, dem no sabi how dramatically di abortion rights movement go take skata after last month wey Supreme Court don give di right to anybody wey dey inside di Webster case.

E be one of di smallest change for public attitude wey I don ever see," na so di former Reagan pollster Richard Wirthlin take talk am.

Dis days, when oder people dey push on top abortion matter, na so so yeye president dey para on top of mouth almost to di point of currity.

Ten days ago, dem tell am sey make e give back all di reasons why e dey do dis anti-abortion matter. E say my position dey very, very well, very stately.

Close eye on top im record wey don dey drag drag for 15 years now show sey Oga, bush don dey para on top all di matter.

For 1974 when U.S. representative for United Nations, e write introduction to one book wey talk about im leadership during im time wen e dey rule for Congress to expand family planning for poor people.

For president wey dey rule for 1980, dem still talk sey im dey support Federal Fund for abortion in case of rape, incest, and save di life of di mama.

For inside im Rolling Stone interview for 1980, Oga Bush bin do abortion right to separate imsef from im rival Ronald Reagan.

In addition to supporting Roe vs.

Wonder Supreme Court dey take legal basis for abortion, Mr. Bush say im dey against constitutional ban on abortion wey be sey Mr. Reagan dey promise to promote.

But dis one wey be sey Oga, na im be Oga, na im be sey Oga, na im be sey Oga, na im be sey Oga, na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey, na im be sey,

E acknowledge only one difference wit Oga, Reagan say di amendment suppose get exception for rape, and incest as well as for save woman life.

During di 1980 era, Oga Bush dey yarn sometimes sey im dey support federal funding for abortion in cases of rape, incest, sometimes opposition.

For April 1986, den Vice President Bush, im staff write one letter wey e go carry out say e go support one constitutional amendment wey dem dey call abortion except for cases of rape, incest, and life endngerment, but dat one na di last one.

For di Republican convention last year, im come out again come out for one amendment wey get exception for rape, incest, and life endngerment.

His talk get momentum as e roll into office e say e dey "firm support of our cause" during one anti-ABbortion rally three days after e do im inauguration for January.

E again come push for one constitutional amendment, wey be abortion.

But when di Moder Court rule for Webster case for July, di Presido begin reduce di volume.

When di ruling rule, di vacation president come send di Chief of Staff, John Sununu ehm to issue statement, and e no gree answer.

Later, e come threaten vexnashon on top bill wey restoring district of Columbia right to use im own tax money take fund abortion for poor women, and e go restore funding to United Nations Population Fund.

But in di months since den, when e try to drum up support for oder issues like anti-flag constitutional amendment e don stop to dey talk about abortion.

For one meeting wey Catholic lawyers for Boston last month, some kind comments wey e don start don cause parabol, like say e dey ask for greater effort to protect human life.

White House don likewise comot hand for inside Florida new legislative session on abortion wey anti-American lawmakers don treat as key test of deir ability to get state lawmakers to tough abortion restrictions.

Di session fail to enact any new curb.

Now, some of dem dey see Mr. Bush for one position wey e no dey comfortable wit, e no fit eskape.

Ken Ruberg wey be the chairmo of the Republican Mainstream Committee, one group of party wey dey moderate, na im dey yarn sey administration dey find imsef for inside political culcation wey be sey e go find am hard if not impossible to escape.
