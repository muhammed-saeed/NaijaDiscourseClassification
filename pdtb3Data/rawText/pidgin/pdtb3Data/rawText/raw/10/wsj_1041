Federal Health officials dey expected today to approve one programme wey dey give long-deserving access to di drug AZT for children wey get immune deficiency syndrome.

Louis Sullivan wey be di secretary for health and human services go wan take announce di approval.

Di clearance by di Food and Drug Administration afta two years wey the youngest victims of AIDS go, only anti-viral drug still dey to treat di fatal sickness.

Dem go do treatment treatment to find out if new drug status dey, label am wit medicine wey get good dose but e no get formal approval.

Di move go give di drug free of charge for small time to pikin dem wey get di diziz and contagor.

Adults wey dey give Aids don get AZT (Afta FDA don approve make dem dey use am for adult adults) for March 1987.

But after more than two years wey research show sey AZT fit cure deaf, and oder tings for pikin, but no federal approval still dey for di youngest patients.

Because of dis one, many young people no dey fit get di medicine, and for some exception, insurance company no go fit cover di money of $6,400 per year.

So far, AIDS don affect 1,859 children under age 13 wit many, many times wey de believe say dem dey carry di infection wit symptoms.

To date, 1,013 of dose children don die according to Federal Bureau for Disease Control.

Some young AIDS suffer sotey e dey pain dem well well.

Tank goodness, e dey happen.

Elizabeth Glaser wey be Los Angeles mama and activist wey contract di AIDS virus through blood transfusion, con carry am go give two of her children.

One of dem, one daughter Ariel, e don die a year ago when e dey seven years after im papa and mama no gree plead for di medicine.

I fit get AZT, says Mrs Glaser wey dey bear am no get any kind diziz, but my daughter no fit, until she too sick to take am.

Watching your pikin die is an inhuman experience. Her pikin wey dey healthy, and healthy, now no dey take any medication.

Di delay to reach AZT na different tin wey dey cause am.

Traditionally, medical establishment don wait for two years to approve adult treatment for pediatrics because of combination of safety standard and red tape.

Second of all, critics don come out against AZT creator Burroughs Wellcome Co, and corporate inertia because children dey only 1% of di patient population, and hence na small part of di big and lucrative market.

Wellcome don yarn sey e dey move forward to compile di relevant data, and recently we don promise to develop pediatric syrup wey dey easy for children to take.

But all dis one still dey come almost a year, and half after Philip Pizzo wey be National Cancer Institute, don talk am sey AZT fit stop AIDS dementia, sometimes e go lead to dramatic recovery of IQ level, and loss of motor skills.

Since den, about 50 pediatric patients don receive di medicine for im programme.

For some mama dem, di expected FDA action na very, very strong reminder of wetin fit don happen.

Sey my first reaction na, I no just understand why e dey take so long.

Why e don take people long enough to understand pediatric AIDS? Na big wahala, ask Helen Kushnick wey im pikin Samuel don die six years ago, at di age of three, because of one tainted transfusion.

Si as e dey do for Capitol Hill o.

While I dey happy di FDA don finally release AZT for children, e don dey too long to reach dis point," Rep. Ted Weiss, why e take burroughs wellcome so long to apply for treatment, new medicine, New York Democrat asked.

Moh we no forget dis na di same company wey don dey profit dis medicine for 2 1/2 years o, Oga Weiss add.

Mrs. Glaser wey be co-founder of di pediatric AIDS Foundation, wey dey Santa Monica, CA, don condemn di bureaucratic, and corporate footdragging.

E say di number one ting wey dey important na make we dey learn our lesson well, and make we make sure sey any oda type of IUD like Bristol Myers Co, na DDI, no follow di same nonsense as AZT.

Aids dementia (wey dey small, small), na im dey make small, small pikin dey speak, dey waka, dey tink, na im be di most annoying part of di difren sickness wey dey make pikin fit talk, dey waka, dey think.

Some patients, AZT don restore power to dey ride bicycle, dey solve puzzle, dey give back part of deir pikin only small.

E dey impossible to overstate how much dis tin dey mean to di families of dis patients," na so Samuel broder, wey be di director for National Cancer Institute, and na main developer of AZT.
