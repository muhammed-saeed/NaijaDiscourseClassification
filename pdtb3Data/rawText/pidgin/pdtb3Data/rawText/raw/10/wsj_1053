Maggie Thatcher must do something right, her political enemies dey shaut more, more.

Mrs. Thatcher wey dey read mylips school before Oga Bush encounter am, e don show her opposition to refashion Britain free market policy to scata bureaucrats for Brussels.

Dem excoy Mrs. Thatcher from Fleet Street to Paris as obstruction.

E con happen sey Mrs. Datcher travel go di whole world go di 49 member Commonwealth summit for Kuala Lumpur to disqualify di Holy Order of Consensus Builders.

One wahala for Malaysia, na im dey shout Manchester Guardian sey she no fit dey behave for inside civilised fashion wey dey unflated for obodo Oyibo.

Canada Brian Mulroney, and Australia Bob Hawke, di paper yarn sey e dey vex, London Times yarn sey e get conscriptoro.

Sey as per usual, her sin dey yarn wetin she tink.

She don sama separate statement, separate herself from one Commonwealth document wey dey bring out political value against South Africa.

While supporting Commonwealth, in utter condemning apartheid, her statement urged it to "encourage change", rather than to unleash further punishment on di country black population.

Actually, dere is a consensus somewhere on top of sanctions: in May a Gallup poll, most African black, 85%, most oppose economic sanctions.

Still, Mrs. Datcher don go against grain again.

Malaysia Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, na im dey sniff say if everybody bring deir left foot, you bring your right foot, you don step o, Mrs. Thatcher say if na one against 48, I dey very sorry for di 48.

If indeed Mrs. Thatcher get one opponent wey fit trow her for political side, na Britain ogbonge alias intractable inflation problem.

But we no fit join political chorus wey one talk about how we go do am be sey Mrs. Thatcher no gree join.

E dey refreshing to see at least one person wey sabi wetin e believe and e no dey rush to do wetin e believe.

Maybe Mrs. Thatcher understands better pass those distressed by her style wey Xtra, and Britain voters go decide who dey right on top Europe matter, to sanction South Africa, or to run Britain economy.
