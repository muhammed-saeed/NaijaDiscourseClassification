For former USSR, chairman, David M. Roderick may have been lucky sey e retire last May.

As e take give the reins to Charles A. Corry, the iron come finish for where dem dey call cyclical peak.

Importation na wahala, but e no dey run comot for market, American company bin get high hope sey dem go extend dis steel import quota another five years.

E fit be sey, person wey dey important pass, wey im name na Carl Icahn, don already threaten to take over as king.

Sey im, and Oga Roderick dey even chop together.

Today, Oga Corry dey control one company wey e be sey deir fortune don change.

Mr. Icahn di company deep pocket, tenacious annoyant recently, na im e don raise im USX stake to thirteen1%, and again e threaten takeover.

Awa battle with Oga God, Ikahn even di most sabi man executive go comot say noting wey take the helm last five month.

USX giant steel, wey dey sell 34% of wetin dey 1988, dey fall on top soft price, dey fall on top more of wetin dey come from foreign steel, and low cost of little oil.

Di import quota get only 2 1/2 years extension, and USX dey labour under di staggering $58 billion wey be sey e go pay to upgrade steel mills, and drill for oil, na baptizim of fire for Corry.

Di burning question na weda di new oga go fit resign Mr. Ikahn without sey e go enter unwelcome move.

Oga Corry fit don comot di company pass wetin e wan do.

Or e might have to incur huge expense of either buying Mr. Icahn stock, maybe at a premium, or paying stockholder special dividend, because of Mr. Icahn pressure.

Wit di latest one wey e buy from USX common stock, Oga God, Isaak don already get three years old, wey no dey inside dis agreement with Oga God, Roderick.

For 1986, Oga Roderick just dodge Oga Ikahn first bullet after di takeover specialist don build eleven4% stake.

Oga Roderick collect USX don sell one special note wey get guarantee, one move wey be sey na like $7.19 billion Icahn bid by about $3 billion.

And e manage to stop small -small tins, even to setol small tins with di yeye tins wey e dey do.

On top of dinner for New York City, and link club, di steel executive, and di big investor talk about, international trade, and horse wey get big name.

Oga Corry wey don bone up on top corporate raider now by reading T.Boone Pickens autobiography, e bin get hope say di detente go continue.

Dem surprise am, some of im associates talk sey e go learn about Oga Ikahn new takeover threat (dem no gree interview am for dis article), but di strong head wey im get, Oga Corry kwik-kwik show am im head.

Im come kukuma with directors for one special meeting wey dem do two weeks ago, come try block im opponent.

Aldough di board believe sey Oga Ikahn dey more interested to talk di stock price pass acquiring USX, e con adopt poison poison go put for di person head if e dey carry di 15% stake.

Now na Oga Ikahn move.

You tink sey e go fit win seat on-top or kontrol board wey go give dem pawa to take divide USX, USX, to separate oil, and steel company?

Give up weakness for bad bond market, can he finance a buy out?

Mr. Icahn may not want to sell unless e get special dividend like di one wey e get before e sell im stake for Tezaco Inc for June, a coup wey give am enough money to take move im USX.

And although na di latest one wey don happen for di stock market, na im don make am difficult for dem to arrange takeover loan, e don reduce some of di wahala wey be sey na over oyibo, sey oyibo, sey oyibo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo, sey ebo

In fact, e never even begin for Oga, Corhian wey dey face serious wahala before im go enter im new work o, sey na vulnerable position im dey because im no get any credibility on top im own o, according to Bryan Jacoboski wey be securities analyst for PaineWeber Inc.

Di 57 years old tax lawyer never even ask di oga of di governing body kweshon.

One university student wey no fit stand for zoology until e conclude sey im no fit stand to dey cut frogs, Oga Corry wan work for one big company wey fit do big tings, but after e join USX subsidiary wey be USX subsidiary 30 years ago, e con plan to become tax department by di age of 46.

For years now, im just park go back of accounting room dey wear hat to work because every oda person don do, e talk am for one earlier interview sey I no be rebel o, sey most of di people wey dey around me, de no go ever talk sey dem see me dey pound table, or dey vex.

But di one wey no suppose suppose be Oga, Corry help chart USX transition from Big Steel to Big Oil.

E do Oga Roderick front man for di 1982 buy of Marathon oil for $5.9 billion naira.

But Oga Corry, wey be di chief executive once, e no waste time o from im former oga wey get office on top di 62nd floor of di USX tower for Pittsburgh.

After dem chopulate last June, na Oga Corry resignment on top of clerical workers, a move wey be sey Oga Roderick never still collect in spite of improved earnings.

Oga Corry too don rule say all board meeting go dey for Pittsburgh instead of New York, or Findlay, Ohio, Marathon house.

And earlier dis month, e don announce di sale of Texas oil & Gas (wey be sey de don get am three years ago) wey be sey de never put big profit on top di stock wey be sey de bin get three years ago.

One former executive come talk sey nobody want make di deal for USX unless sey na Dave Roderick wey be hunter, and fisherman of William L. Hutchison wey be di chairman for Texas oil & Gas.

Di executive recall Oga, Corry dey whisper to am, and oders sey dis one na Dave deal.

Wetin Iffed, many USX executive, and shareholder na sey di acquisition, for three billion stock, double di USX share outstanding, plenty, plenty share wey dem share well, well.

Di one wey worse pass na natural gas price wey fall on top Texas Oil & Gas for di first time inside 28 years.

Oga Corry expect Texas oil & gas market to delight Oga Icahn when e address im concern on top how to boost shareholder value.

But when di two of dem meet for New York one day after Oga Icahn show dem di rise of im USX stake, Oga Corhian tell am sey Oga Icahn want make e sell all Texas oil, no be only about one billion pound of natural gas, and 28 million gallons of oil, plus di pipeline, gas gats, and contract millennas.

Dat one go leave USX with Marathon, im steel mills, im diversify business segment wey include, among oder tings, mineral, and transportation.

Some dey speculate sey Oga Corry go gree if e fit find customer for di correct price.

Di problem be sey Oga Ikahn dey push am to move sharperly, sharperly for inside restructuring wey be sey Oga, Corry bin plan.

Oga Icahn don long believe, goment don talk sey, di company wey dey sell 1988 talk sey na $16.88 billion, na im worth $ 70 billion ah if dey break up.

Di stock close yesterday at $33.625 giving Mr. Icahn's 33.6 million share for di $1.13 billion.

Mr. Icahn advocate di sale of di company steel, and Mr. Corry no just gree.

No be im predecessor wey see steel say na America backbone, Oga Corry dey look am like capital punishment, and labour wey no fit do am at all.

For five years wey don pass now, USX don dey melt gold to powder, e don dey sell many plants and reduce labour cost.

But di short term outlook, na so.

No be sey Messrs surprise o.

Rokelin and Corry see steel differently.

While Mr. Roderick dey for where dem dey keep smoke for Pittsburgh, Mr. Corry grow for one city wey dem dey call Porkapolis, and e dey chop meat pass pig iron.

E never do meet Lynn Williams wey be president of United Steel Workers Union, and e no dey do di main work group, di American Iron and Steel Institute wey Mr. Roderick don serve as chairman.

E say dave think say di country need strong U.S. Steel, but Chuck gree sey e go fit say no be sey dem dey pay shareholders at any rate.

True, true, Oga Corry, for August press, talk about investing in steel, as long as it provides a good return, and not a day extension.

But, to give Oga Roderick di original reason why e dey diversify oil, and gas, dat di two main thing go reduce di risk of di company to one market wey go dey sell cash, and earnings.

As Oga Roderick once say we be two product company, and o boy, if you no fit know di value of dat two part, you be so stupid you no belong wall of street.

And dis one wey be sey de sell steel for price wey be sey de sell am for USX now, sey time don pass wey be sey we go dey spin iron, wheder na for open market, abi na for person wey be business man, na im dey argue.

Sey dis one wey USX dey now, di only way wey USX go fit take comot am from steel, na to take am out, to take am out, to separate joint venture, e add.

But dis one wey be sey Oga God, wey be Oga God, wey be Oga God, wey be sey Oga God, wey be sey Oga God, na small price o, wey be sey de dey sell small, small money even if na sey de dey sell some tax wey be sey de dey sell wetin be sey de dey sell.

Dat one go leave USX basically anoda oil company wit Marathon.

Marathon don gain from better better price of oil and di strong demand wey e dey sell for market.

Oil don tay, Oga Corry pet.

True, true, when Bush administration finally decide dis summer to renew import restriction, e likely be di biggest decision wey go affect di steel industry for five years. Oga Corry and im company dey inside one aeroplane wey high pass for Marathon oil wey dey inside North Sea.

Make USX dey only with Marathon o, Oga, Corry fit dey push to push out oder power company o.

But even USX executives wey dey work closely with am no sure of im long term goals sef, I no tink sey im know where im wan make di company go sef ah.

Oya now, executive come add sey e wan continue to dey focus on top how to dey pay down, USX wey dey sell asset.

But one tin wey dey certain be sey Oga Corry, when e dey read oder option, maybe e no go do big move until e go clear on top Oga Ikahn plan.

And den, e no go panic, J. Bruce Johnston wey be former USX executive, and now, na labourer and benefit consultant wit Adler Cohen & Grigsby for Pittsburgh na im talk dis one.

Oga Corry bin dey under fire when as vice president of corporate planning, e handle wetin Mr. Johnston call "don't con-me" negotiation wey lead to USX shed plenty, plenty asset wey range from chemicals to construction.

When dem dey negotiate, Oga Corry play im card wey dey near di vest.

Johnnie Johnson wey work for Oga God for strategic planning, recall how im oga go dey routine to ask subordinate to do research for all di whole industry to target acquisition candidates, na one company e really want to know, but you no know dat one.

E want una own impartiality, virgin opinion, na im dey manage director for Georgeson & Co, one person wey be proxy solicitation, and investor relations firm.

Ever di pragmatist, Oga Corry bin yarn for August sey im see sey USX dey on top acquisition screen all over di country.

E say na part of di capitalistic market system wey be sey equity na buy, and equity na buy.

ONE USX, e note, e don form 88 years now wey e dey buy big, big company wey dem dey call jw.org, because people dey get plenty money through the takeover wey dem dey do for dat days, as dem dey do today.
