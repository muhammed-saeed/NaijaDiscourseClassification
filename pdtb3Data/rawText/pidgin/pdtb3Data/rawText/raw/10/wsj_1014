Anheuser, wey be world largest broadcaster and U.S. market leader before, e no dey gree sell price cut wey be sey de dey increase sales.

But di way we take dey carry di head day wey be sey de dey sell wine, con dey increase evriday, and di short price wey we dey sell for market con dey increase evriday.

For dry season, Anheuser competitor give us plenty discount pass people wey dey buy wetin we dey sell before.

Di total total wey dem sell for di third time na $249 billion e get from di last year wey be $234 billion.

Anheuser talk sey di new strategy wey e start for some market last month, and wey dem dey plan to do small, small business for nationwide market, go mean sey di last half of 1989, and 1990, go reduce.

Di projection send Anheuser to take measure $4.375 for New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.

Anheuser note sey di beer market volume na 1989 e dey follow di trend wey don divide di last half of di 80 naira with sales volume wey be sey na flat, but consolidation dey create fewer big, big players.

We no fit allow further slowing for di volume trend again, Anheuser talk, e go add am join di competition price wey be sey go support our long term market share growth strategy for di premium market.

Anheuser talk sey e continue to hold di original goal of 50% U.S. market wey be mid-1990.

Beneath di tin wey dey bring out jargon, na im bring out a huge threat from di brewing giant wey reach about 41% of all U.S. beer sales last year and na im dey expected to grow reach 42.5% inside di current year. Joseph J. Doyle wey be oga patapata for di barroom brawl, na im talk sey na im be di biggest man for di barroom, na im be di barrow, na im be analyst wit Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.

Jerry Steinman, wey be Beer Marketers Insights, one trade letter, e yarn sey obodo people for di industry, sey e go suffer wella, well go reach deir profit.

Prenential Bache Securities Inc, one analyst, George E. Thompson, na im dey yarn di importance of di announcement, and dem call am any joinbody wey sele on top di coming beer industry sacrifice, unwarranted.

Mr. Thompson call down "a loser's game for anyone wey no get dominant market", and projected sey Anheuser's statement of intent fit just be warning comrade for price cutting, or e go fit face a costly and useless battle.

Mr. Thompson talk sey di money wey dey fall five percent on top im own projection, contribute to di sell of shares wey be sey na edgy and now unforgiving investment.

But Smith Barney Oga, wey yesterday cut im 1990 Anheuser earnings to $2.95 a share from $3.10, call am a share from di market na akordin to wetin dey happen for di third quarter earnings, e say di real bad news na di intensity of price wey dey sell for Premium Beer sector.

E follow by Stroh Brewery Co, wey don gree sell im asset to Coors.

Coors and Stroh just dey cedar share give Miller, and Anheuser.
