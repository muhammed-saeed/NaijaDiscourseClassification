(For centennial year, Wall Street Journal go report tins of di past century wey be sey na milestone for American business history.)

Thomas Jefferson sell Congress on top di idea of di decimal system for currency, e come dey give Americans headache wey be sey pounds, shillings, and pence.

But e follow di one wey dey weigh and measure wey French pipol dey use measure.

Instead, Congress choose for di inches, leg, and yards wey di colonists carry.

American people no dey like metrics, de just ignore dem.

Observers dey see am differently.

By di time di century end, scientists don embrace di system.

Business men con take deir cue from engineer.

Today, even though sey public dem no dey too know, many of di U.S. industry, especially di one wey be sey dey do, especially di one wey be sey dey do, dey do measurement.

For example, General Motor dey use metrium take measure im body, and power train. For inside motor advertising, dem still dey describe di tins wey be sey na in inches. Farm mahnsef, di one wey be sey na metrium and deere dey inside di metrium.

Di liquor industry don go metric 10 years now.

Still, like di one wey be sey dey deal wit Oga, everyman wey be sey military stick to try, try, try.
