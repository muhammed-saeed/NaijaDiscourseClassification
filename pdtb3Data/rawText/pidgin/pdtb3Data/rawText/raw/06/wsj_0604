Kaider, Peabody & Co., de wan struggle back.

E never too tey wey di 124 years old securities firm just dey on top one kind wahala wey dey cause big wahala and sickness just dey on top am.

E get one matter wey concern parent General Electric Co, wey don dey drag since one big kidnapper wahala, two years ago.

Chief Executive, and Presido don show o.

Now, firm dey yarn sey e don dey turn.

After dis year, 63 years old chairman, Silas Cathcart, wey be former chairman of Illinois Tool Works, when e carry am come back to clean up Kidder for 1987, na im retirees go im Lake Forest Ill, Ill, home, possibly to build shopping mall on top some land wey e carry come do.

And dat mean sey 42 years old Michael Carpenter, president and chief executive since January, na im go do di first time complete control of Kidder, come try do better for grandiose plan.

Oga Carpenter talk sey e go return Kidder to prominence as big investment bank.

Wall Street dey understandable.

For di first nine months of di year, Kidder rank among di underwriters of U.S. stock and bond, na 2,8% market share, up to 2,5% for di year earlier period according to Securities Data Co.

E still fall wen Kidder still dey count am as investment bank.

Gary S. Goldstein wey be di president for Whitney Group, one executive wey dey search firm talk sey, I go like see Kai (Kidder succeed).

But de gats attract better, better banker wey fit bring di business from day one.

For 1988, Kiddo release $46 million profit, mostly because of severe cost.

Na 1,400 member of di yearly association dem talk sey na like five million lost last year but Kidder expect sey na money dem go gain dis year.

In fact, Kidder na just little player for every business e dey do, except sey na computer programme dey do, for dat controversial business, na only Morgan Stanley and Co. rivals Kidder na im dey do.

But even dat niche dey under attack as some Wall Street firm pull down for programme last week for big investors hand.

Oga Carpenter, wey be former consulting firm executive wey get love for tickler, talk sey im don do di complete rethink of Kidder inside di recent months.

Di show wey di firm do, show sey e dey yuzles.

More than 20 new Managing Director and senior vice president don dey since January.

Dem don trim di company broders wey be sey de wan start business, join body wey be sey de wan start business, join body wey be sey de wan start business, join body wey be sey na like 55 people dey register.

Oga Carpenter talk sey when e assume sey na full, e go con finally tap into resources of GE.

One of GE'S goal wen e buy 80% of Kidder for 1986, na to take advantage of Syngeri between Kidder, General Electric Corp, GE corporate unit wey get four billion hey o.

Di leveraged buy out group of GE Capital now, dem dey report to Oga Carpenter.

So far, instead of join body, GE Capital staffers, and Kidder Investment Bankers don baptize.

But, Oga Carpenter talk sey we don really start to exploit di synergy between GE Capital, and Kidder Peabody. Di unit don do 37 investment bank deal dis year, e say but no be all of dem don cancel.

We don do good relationship for GE, di first time wey you fit talk sey eh make I withdraw dat one.

Oga Carpenter talk sey di tin just dey improve relationship now.

Still, without many actual deal wey kidnap, Kidnap dey para sey na now team dey come, and every man wey dey work hard.

One month ago, di firm start to dey do meeting for about 7:30 per night, about 50 to 60 of di 350 pipol wey dey inside di investment bank, we don dey do am well, well, well pass as e dey be before. Scott C. Newquist, wey be di head of Investment Bank since June.

Everywhere, Kidd dey stress dialways working theme.

One new in-house magazine, Kidder World, wey go focus on top di firm synergy strategy, na im e dey talk o sey on Friday, Mr. Newquist talk sey if you dey fly im single engine, Centurion dey go Nantucket.

Di firm new head of merger, and acquisition under Oga Nyamast, B.J Megargel talk of di opportunity to rebuild franchise for Kidder wey be sey di name na only six, or seven wey every CEO go know as viable alternative when dem dey consider a merger deal.

Now according by one small story about Oga God Megargel, all di firm ones wey dey do now, na to show oursef inside di matter wey dey go on top di matter.

Wit investment banking na Kidder business, where Kidder 42 brocher network, and di 1,400 broker fit enter?

Mr. Carpenter dis month, na im de sell out Kidder office for Florida, and Puerto Rico go Merrill Lynch & Co, refueling speculation sey Kidder dey comot from di broker business entirely.

Oga Carpenter deny di speculation.

To answer di gragra question, Kidder, in typical fashion complete task force study.

Di result be sey, Kidder go focus on top rich, rich investors, small company, wey near di clientele of goldman, Sachs & Co, dan to dey serve di world firm like Merrill Lynch, or Shearson Lehmann in di Hutton Inc. Oga Carpenter talk sey dis kind investors too dey comot eye for di matter wey be sey Kidder dey aggressive to dey do business o.

As part of di upscale push, Kidd dey put oga dem through 20 weeks training, turn dem to investment adviser wit corporate finance.

De go get new, better tools wey de go sell, especially to di affluent investor, na im di oga patapata, chief Charles V. Sheehan.

Orethically, di brokers go con fit dey funnel (leads) on corporate finance opportunity to Kidder investment banker, maybe easing di long tension between di two camps.

But, skeptics talk sey dis kind cross polination wey dey between broder, and investment banker, e dey big for paper, but e no dey always happen.

Kidder competitors no dey vex for di firm as many dey vex for strong competitor like Drexel Burnham Inc. Dat one no get Kidder history.

But, competitors talk sey Kidder dey employ people wey be executive level staffer, some wey be multiple years contract, fit returnfire unless result dey.

Di departing Mr. Attract talk sey im no get any worry for Kidder future.

Mr. Atkart wey go return to di Quaker Oats Co. (Apart from im own venture wey e dey do, e go carry small, small budget, dey plan wetin e go do for Kidder wey be freewheel.)

E still improve how di firm dey do wetin dem dey sell.

Oga Atkart talk sey e don do big boy for Kidder, e don add crack for im being being a "toolanddie man", e no con vex for am. E say na one kind wonderful line, and na one I don use many times.

Sing broadly when e dey talk about Mr. Carpenter, Mr. Cathcart talk sey di new Kidder chief, dey go soon as one of di real leaders for di investment banking business o, in coming years, Mr. Cathcart talk sey Kidder go hum.

Or as Mr. Carpenter again dey draw on top im consultancy background say we dey ready to do at dis point.
