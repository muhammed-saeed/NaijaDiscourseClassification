Ice-blok wey dey ontop Tibet fit still help us know weda e dey warm or e dey cold.

Research people for Ohio State University, and Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Geocryology for China don look different ice-blok for Tibet sey weather don hot well, well pass di one wey don dey since 10,000 years.

Ice-blok na one important part of the science wey dey support sey di sun don dey hot well, well, mostly because of pollution for air, and warming up well, well for di century wey dey ahead.

Some of di ice-blok wey dey di sea go melt, sotey e go form big ice-blok wey go dey bring fresh breeze.

If you fit use dat one take reconstruct wetin don happen before, you don too get more confidence sey predictment for future na im Lonnie Thompson, one research scientist for Ohio State wey dug for ice-blok, talk am.

Dem talk sey to compare temperature wey don pass 10,000 years, different different kind of oxygen, dem look am.

Dem say dis measurement fit indicate temperature change, because di nugget of dis oxygen atoms dey different from di one wey dey normal.

Analysis of ice from Dunde ice cap, one glacial plateau for Tibet, 17,000 feet above sea level, na im make di weather for di 37-87 level high pass any other hotice wey don dey since di last Ice Age. Mr. Thompson talk.

Some climate model wey dey inside Asia go dey among di first heat wey go dey for world because e dey far from sea and e dey hot well-well.

But di ice-blok samples no be final proof say di so-so greenhouse effect go lead to further global warming, Oga Thompson don acknowledge.

According to greenhouse theory, increase of CO2 gas, mostly from di burning of fossil fuel, na im go make di earth warm because carbon dioxide no dey let heat escape from space.

Sekrets talk sey if na so di matter be, sey temperature don dey go up well, well for di past century because of di way carbon dioxide dey come out.

Di Dunde ice-blok record show sey from 1900 go rish 1950, weather don dey reduce from 1950 go reach mid-1970, den weather go hot again for di last year.

Other temperature data show di same misunderstanding.

Kailimate varies greatly due to natural causes, says Oga Thompson.

But ice-blok wey dey Peru, Greenland and Antarctica show strong sign sey warming don start.
