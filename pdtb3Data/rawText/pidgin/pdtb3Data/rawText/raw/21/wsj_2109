National Geographic, di sixth largest U.S. magazine, e dey attract more readers pass before and e dey provide high quality pages wey evribody dey like.

So why advert page na na ten, and ad revenue na seven percent for first half?

For person wey dey advertise magazine, to hear am, di magazine never keep up wit di time.

Even though sey di public still dey put eye for di matter like environment, and Third World, e never still get popularity as tori boy now, wey dey go find oda oda tribe women.

Better gi-... better gi-... better gi-... better gi-... better gi-... better gi-... from regional edition go gi-... discount for pipol wey dey advertise.

But now, di magazine dey wan come back wit one ambitious plan, plus one new sales strategy, and one very aggressive campaign.

Di advertisers no tink of di magazine matter first, Joan McCartney wey join for April as National Advertiser talk sey wetin we wan do now, na to do am sharperly.

People no believe sey we dey tune market, and many, many way we no dey.

Di 101 years old magazine never come dey attract advertisers like dis before.

Di number na mostly hard to get, na 108 million subscribers in di first half, from 10.5 million to 10.5 million a year ago, an average of 42 for readers, at di height of deir consuming years, loyalty to di tune of 85% on monthly subscription.

The magazine get only one year wey e do for 1988, when e do one hundrednial and e gain reach 17% for inside ad page 283

But dis year, when di hullabaloos surround im centennial, na so some advertisers too follow join.

Di reason, ad executives talk sey, di whole magazine business don dey soft, and National Geographic get some kind quarrel wey dey make am especially when soft market dey.

Some of the things wey big pass na the high ad price (money wey dem dey sell for one four page ) vs. $47,000 naira for Smithsonian akordin to di small small market wey dem dey sell.

When ad dollars are tight, high page price na one kind big deal for people wey dey advertise wetin dem dey always see inside magazine, or e no dey sell at all.

Even dough National Geographic publish more dan one magazine like Smithsonian, di page dey cost you arm, and leg to develop any frequency, says Harry Glass, New York Media Manager for Bozel Inc.

To stop dat problem, National Geographic, like oda magazine, con begin dey give local magazine, dey allow advertisers to dey inside only one part of di magazine. For example, advert fit only dey inside di magazine wey dey send to subscribers inside di largest 25 market.

But di magazine nor dey competition with di oda tins wey e dey sell and until last year, e nor dey competition with di ones wey e dey sell.

For example, Time Magazine get more than 100 separate editions wey dey go regions, top management, and oder groups.

Anoder point wey dey point for advertisers, na di National Geographic tradition of lumping di advert together usually for di beginning, or end of di magazine, instead of to dey spread advert for inside di articles wey dey inside di magazine, as most magazine dey do.

And National Geographic dey small for di average size na extra production cost for advertisers.

But Ms. McCartney talk sey di magazine dey fight back.

E don dey sell 30 regional edition now, e don begin dey do adverts near di articles and e don dey beef up di sales force.

And e just launch one promotional campaign to tell chief executives, marketing directors, and media executives just dat.

Di centerpiece of di promotion na im new ad campaign wey di magazine go pour about $500,000, mostly in di next few weeks.

Di campaign wey Omnicom Group, DDB Needham Agency dey do, dem dey use am dey catch eye wey be sey National Geographic dey.

For one ad, one photo of incense wey dey inside di Sainte-Chapelle for Paris pair di headline, di only book wey we get pass we no dey accept advert. Anoda image wey dey inside tree ant, magnifying 80 times for di headline, for impact wey you no know about dis our regional edition.

Ms. McCartney talk sey di campaign na to help advertisers for 10 categories like corporate, financial service, consumer electronics, insurance, food.

Her plan na to reach 300 ad pages for 1990 until about 274 a year.

Weda she fit meet dat ambitious goal still dey far, na im be sey di ad campaign na to contemporize wetin National Geographic talk, she talk sey we wan make am 90s kind of image.
