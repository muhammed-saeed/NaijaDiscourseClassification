Poleroid Corp. Di patent infringement case against Eastman Kodak Co, one of di biggest corporate trial ever, dey go on top Wall Street.

After 78 days wey im mind no settle matter for federal court for Boston, di trial na im analysts and patent lawyer don ignore am.

But most of dem don read di pre-trial document, and dem dey estimate sey dem go order Kodak to pay $1 billion to $1.5 billion for inside seven Polaroid patent.

Dat one fit be di biggest patent award ever, but well, well under di $12 billion Polaroid seek.

Di highest patent wey dem get to date, na 1986 when dem tell Smith International Inc sey make e pay $205 million to Baker Hughes Inc for infringing one patent on top one oil drilling bit of seal.

Di two company later gree to settle $ 95 million.

Some analysts say e dey worth deir time to log through Polaroid trial testimony, e be like panning for gold outside Grand Central Station.

Michael Ellman wey be analyst for Valueheim Sirder & Co talk sey, di chances no too dey high.

And Eugene Glazer, one analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc, na im talk sey if you employ one attorney to dey dere, and give you award of eventual award, I go ready to bet sey im go dey show well, well.

For the seventy days trial wey dem go do for October 1980, dem come see am sey Kodak wey dey Rochester, N.Y., come dey keep one patent for Polaroid wey dey Cambridge, Mass.

Di main ting wey remain na how to calculate damages, and wheder di infringement na willful and deliberate, if na like dat, di damage go be times three.

Two analyst wey don read di transcript, David Nelson of Shearson Lehmann Ink, and Calv D. Crary, one lawyer for Labe, Simpson & Co, think of Judge A. David Mazzone go decide in Kodak's favour on top di "willful and deliberate" issue.

Mr. Crary tok with Kodak patent lawyer, Francis T. Carry of Kenyon & Kenyon sey e dey always work with Kodak to avoid infringement. Carr tell Kodak many times sey make e dey avoid different different part because of Polaroid patent, and Kodak follow im advice for every instance.

But Irving Kayton wey be patent expert for George Mason University, wey know di matter, talk sey di seven patent wey dey infringe di infringement, na im go do am.

E dey hard to do dat one everytime.

Eyes don dey wonder wheder Judge Mazzone go use di lost profit method take judge damages wey Polaroid go carry on top sey na big award, or na ogbonge royal method.

Poliodaki claim sey e go don manufacture, sell all di instant camera, and film wey Kodak dey sell if e no enter market.

And Polaroid sef, dey argue sey e go sell dem for higher money, and dat one come make plenty money pass di one wey dem dey sell for Kodak.

Every side don call one Harvard Business School professor to testify on top dat issue.

Knodak, na Robert Buzzell, and Polaroid wey carry Robert J. Dolan enter. Noting wey talk sey Harvard Business School go gree for each oda, na im Mr. Buzzell talk.

Testimony suppose continue till December.

Decision no be am until some time next year.
