Oya, you see di following tings about a Philip glass concert.

It attract people with funny hair (or wit no hair)... in front of me a girl wey get spike for her side with one boy wey don cut im hair.

Who be di Local Left Bank member wey wear black cloth, wit yuppies wey wan dey cut edge?

People for glass house dey always look stone.

And if una still know wen evening don rish, una go still si anoda tin wey bi sey: â€˜For di first time wen una hear di music, di tin wey e dey sing dey make una kry well-well.

For di centre of four weeks, 20 city tour as single pianist, Mr. Glass don leave for back of im synthesizers, equipment, and collaborators to dey go am alone.

E dey sit down for di piano, dey play instrument.

and dey play.

Weda person like am, or person no like am.

Di typical glass audience, wey be sey dey play music pass deir teacher, na im dey do am.

Di work now be like Muzak for where dem dey do spaceship.

Filip Glass na di emperor and e dey play di new dress wey e dey wear for di gardin.

E dey easy for am to succeed.

Just dey introduce, dey explain im piece, Oga Glass dey look, im dey sound like shaggy poet wey dey describe im work pass classical pianist dey play.

Di music wey dem dey call minimalist, Oriental, repetitive, cyclical, monophonic, hypnotic, e dey push well, well, e dey push well, well, e dey push well, well, e dey easy to play, e dey easy to play, e dey easy to play, e dey easy to play, e dey easy to play, e dey easy to play, e dey easy to play, e dey easy to play, e dey easy to play, and e dey easy to play.

Na music for people wey wan hear different tings, but no wan work, especially hard work.

E-... na di generation wey E-... dey now.

Mr. Glass don conquer di popular modernist dictum, less na im dey always less.

Apart from being minimalist, music wey you dey play dey give us, e get as e be sey di music wey you dey play now, no too dey clever for di 4/4 time octave, octave, and octave.

But di music get im charm, and Oga Glass don construct im solo program for one place wey be sey from small, small to small, sey na glass wey be sey na im dey play di two octaves for di middle of C.E.E no dey too far from di piano centre, Oga Glass dey do di two octaves for di middle of C.E. Im fingers no dey leave di keys.

E get one certain musical style here, but no be one particular style.

Di music no be di one wey be sey dey play, na im dey play pass.

Noting bravura, no arpeggio, no tick fingerling problem for di performer.

We hear, we fit tink, inside voice, but e be like sey all of dem dey yarn di same ting.

Wit plan, music mean to accompany reading of Allen Ginsberg's "Witita Vortex Sutra", Oga Glass dey go.

Im hand dey apart for di keyboard.

Sevent chord na make you feel am say e go break into small, small instrument.

Di chords modulate, but di little filigation even dough sey im finger don dey waka small, small.

Difren types of yarn yarn, yarn yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, yarn, and yarn.

When Oga Glass decide to do big, small, e cross e hand, e use e right hand nack Resonant bass note.

: E dey do dis one at least three of im solo pieces.

You fit call am leitmoti, or virtuoso accomplishment.

In Mad Rush wey come from commission write part of indeterminate length.

Glass gentolly, and tell say dis one no be wahala for me, a section alternate wit one B section many times before di piece go end.

No be only di normal piece of glass open, na also many times in di context. Madam start im life as accompaniment for di Dalai Lama first public address for U.S. when Oga Glass play am for di organ for New York Cathedral of St. John di Divine.

After dem do am for Radio Bremen for Germany, den Lucinda Childs come do am for one of her dance.

Di point be sey any piece, you fit use am as background music for anyting.

Di evening con end wit Oga Glass'Metamorphosis, anoder double work.

Parts 1,2, and 5 come from di soundtrack of Errol Morris acclaimed film, di Thin Blue Line, and di two oda parts from incidental music to two drama of di Kafka story of di same name.

When dat time dey, di music get di right eering, as e dey give two note, e dey drop small, small, small, e dey give ear to all di report, interviews, and confessions wey dey inside Morris film.

Serve as single, but music no dey rhyme with another medium.

Oga Admirers of Mr. Glass fit gree with di criticised Richard Kostelanet sey di 1974 music in twelve part, na im encyclopa and weight na di WellTempered Clavier ah but as e be sey deir instrument dey different from di one wey dey di one wey be sey dey different from di one wey be sey dey different from di one wey be sey dey different from di one wey be sey dey different from di one wey be sey dey different from di one wey be sey dey different from di one wey be sey dey different from di one wey be sey dey different from di one wey be sey dey different from di one wey be sey dey different from di one wey be sey dey different from di one wey be sey dey different from di one wey be sey dey different from di one wey be sey dey different from di one wey be sey dey different from di one wey be sey dey different from di one wey be sey dey different from di one wey be sey.

It is apparently austere minimalism overlaying a bomb that makes one year for the stringency of neoclassical Stravinsky, the absolute minimalism of Bergand Webern, and what is now in retrospecting in Mahler.

Oga Spiegelman na professor of English for Southern Methodist University, and di editor of Southwest Review.
