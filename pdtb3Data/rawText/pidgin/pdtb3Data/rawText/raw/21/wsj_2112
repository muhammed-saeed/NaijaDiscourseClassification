Pentagon na building wey don shake before.

Living dere for six years, e dey really scary.

â€œAwa ghosts dey evriwhere, na only to feed dem many tins wey wi take dey defend demsef.

Some fit buy some, e dey very cheap.

During di Korean War, Gen. Douglas MacArthur sey make dem bring am, plus im U.N. command for Korea, plus en own navy command for Japan, NavforJapan.

Dose obsolete operations, e cost less dan $2 billion a year, and di Mac ghost still dey dere.

Dat'S all di cost of appreciating Adm, Erich Raeder ghost.

For 1941, Raeder and Germany navy threaten to enter Panama canal, so we come be di Southern Command for Panama.

Di kommand wey dey for south don even plenty well, well since di war because Raeder ghost dey run sometimes for inside E ring wey be like Gen. Noriega.

Di commanding na huge bureaucracy to look wheder di leaders of coup against Gen. Noriega meet di War Powers Act six point, Cap of Weinburg seven point, Intelligence Committee na 32 point, and Woodrow Wilson 14 point necessary to justify U.S. support.

So far, no one get.

Di ghost of di Soviet brigade wey dem see for Cuba back, na just one hundred million naira di price of di Caribbean Command for Key West wey President Carter don create for 1980.

We never hear di brigade since, but we just dey keep staff in case.

George Marshall ghost na im dey sweet us well well o.

Wi keep many shrine for am around di Pentagon. Di shrine na statue, bus, tear-tear tins, and some oda tins.

Army headquarter for di third floor of di Pentagon, dem burn incense give am, but Navy headquarter for di fourth deck, stop am.

You see, Marshall get dis talk about Navy, and Marine, e wan give dem part of di army, but di secretary for Navy, James Forrestal, na im e get.

Now im ghost no go leave am until di ting don done.

Wi dey kommand one new kommandment evry year, weda na army or air force e go dey kontrol di sojas and dia sojas.

But we still dey hear am for nite, bikos na only small ship remain for di Navy, and to satisfy am di Navy lift, dem come give am one new command for Colorado, wey be sey frog dey enter one new army bureau for Fort Bragg, plus Indian Indian, and Persian Gulf to one army bureau for Florida.

Di one wey worse pass, na Iran own, di one wey worse pass.

When di shah die, Presido Carter come dey fear sotay di shah ghost go blame am for di ayatollah wey e shout say di Carter Doctrine don die.

Oga Carter talk sey im go go war go stop anybody wey wan grab Iran.

But dat ghost, e no gree talk, e wan make money, and people plenty.

So Oga Carter come form three new army division come give one new army for Tampa, wey dey call Rapid Deployment Force.

But dat ghost no fool o, e know sey di RDF no dey move sharp, sharp, even dough sey e cost $8 billion, or 10 billion a year.

After dem win Oga Carter for 1980, di shah ghost claim di credit, den e follow Presido, Presido, Capernier.

I know wetin e do for dem.

E make my shoe dey shake well-well.

Why e be sey e dey wait for Kap, naim e just leap come from behind one statue wey dem dey call Marshall enter Cap, come hold am for neck, come choke am till e cough up to anoder $2 billion or so.

Di Kapana add four divisions to di army, two active, two reserve, two carryrs to di navy, one division a-... equivalent to di Marines, and di C-5b, KC-10, C-17 and 1,000 tactical aeroplane.

E buy four billion in di preposition ship, and seven billion in ammo, and equipment to fill am, come keep am for one new six billion base for Diego Garcia for di middle of di Indian Ocean.

E dedicate all dis new forces to di Persian Gulf.

One night, wey Marshall and the shah ghost gather together, come catch Cap, come troway am for ground.

Before dey allow am go, e add 1,000 bureaucrat to di RDF for Tampa, come give am di Central Command.

Di kommanding offisa dey kontrol evritin wey di ship dey do for Mediterranean Sea and for Persia Sea.

Marshall con feel sey e go good train for dose soldier, maybe de go do di whole waka.

Dem dey happy as dem dey waka, but e con happen sey de forget about my sweeper.

But di shah still dey shaut for Kapanaim, so Kapanaim buy hundred karpenter, one hundred big shariot, one hundred big shariot, one hundred big shariot, one hundred big shariot, one hundred big shariot and one hundred galadim. Dis na to make sure sey di seven new sojas, plus di three ones wey dey inside di tank, dey use dem go war for Zagros mountin.

At wons, Ike ghost come visit, con say wetin be di hell wey you dey plan for land war for Asia, twelve thousand miles?

We go knack our donkey, Lucky for Cap, Ike go soon comot, di shah e dey come back.

So U.S. come show sey e dey pay about $2 billion for baksheesh to all di Arabian potter wey dey fetch right for inside Indian Ocean.

We do well for Somalia.

But na now e con turn out sey Presido Siad Barrah no be better person at all, and Navy point out sey di base wey e promise us for bebera don dey reach about one hundred years now, but anyway na 1,244 miles from di Gulf side (but who dey count) na di best wey we fit get, na im we con stay with Presido Barrah.

All dis talk wey talk about am committing genocide, maybe na exaggeration anyway.

But you no know now sey we dey spend jillion pounds, and we don build di new divisions, and new air feada, and don park all dis ships, and supplies to fight Russia for Iran, Russia people don lose interest for di whole matter.

Meanwhile, Congress dey cut big chunks for di remaining defence budget.

Di oga patapata for di Navy, e con talk sey oya, we still need to keep all di 18 squadrons on top active duty, all dat extra plane wey no get base, all dose squadrons wey dey play for inside Tamar.

Comot $20 billion, or $30 billion a year from di reserves?

And why una go fit use one thousand bureaucrat take skata wetin dey happen for West Eufrates aria, afloat and di task force commander for West Eufrates?

And where all di fine, fine sail wey we pay Indian Ocean all di time last year wey dem dey attack us?

Question like dat con make Marshall ghost.

E appear late one night for di bedroom of di new defence secretary, Dick Cheney.

Di king wey dem dey koll Marley, na like Marley ghost wey dey drag small-small shain, air feada and devil feada.

E no go leave until Mr. Cheney promise to do anytin wey di Pentagon system analysts tell am.

So di next day, Oga Cheney just do wetin e do o, e cancel six hundred, one swod, e cut one, one swod and 20 frigates.

Den e come cancel di most important airline wey be Navy, di F14, and di A-6.

Di oder side, Oga Cheney retained all dose new land force.

Marshall ghost don do now, but e go come back.

Wit Halloween wey dey come, and big security wey dey loom, many, many Pentagon bureaucrat dey crawl dey under deir desk.

Dem know sey na only small dem go fit use take deceive ghosts, na when dem dey cut big, big ship.

Den di whole ting go start to fall like dat for di 1970 eart, and ghost and bans go dey waka pass di place wey dey make people hair white.

Give me di willies just think about am.

Oga Lehman wey be Naval Secretary for Reagan Navy, na di managing director of PaineWeber.
