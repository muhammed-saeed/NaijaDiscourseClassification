After one minute, e shoot out 128, den zoom down 113, 69, for Friday closing.

Sey na madness, sey Neil Weisman, general partner of Chilmark Capital Corp, sey e be like sey dey fly without pilot for front of di plane.

But dose wey say dis one no go happen, dey correct.

Dem dey opress oda pipol.

Quotron Systems Inc, one Citicorp unit, na im blame di 30 minutes foul up on top â€œa timing problem for our software wey be sey na about 145 million share for di first hour of New York Stock Exchange trading.

Quotron sey di money wey dey each row na correct one, but di one wey dey average, na wayo.

Meanwhile, confusion too dey o.

At about 10:40 a.m. on top of the counter trading desk for one major broker, one veteran wey dey buy, sell some of di biggest stock, look at one of di oga dem wey dey dere, ask am sey wetin dey happen?

Market dey up, or down?

Dat time, Quotron dey talk sey di industrial average na down 70 point.

In fact na 24.

Holy Stark, one vice president wey be di trading desk for Dillon Read Capital Corp, na im talk sey once e don calculate di Quotron number, na im e call brokers to tell dem sey e dey yeye to say di least.

To confuse matter further, when UAL Corp. Stock finally come out for New York Stock Exchange for 11:08 a.m., di price na $324.75 a.m., up to $45 per Friday. In fact, di original price na $224.75, down $55 per litre.

Na im come be di New York Stock Exchange blooper.

A spokesman cite one technical error, e declined to elaborate.

And e still get oda blues too.

When market open at 9:30 a.m. EST, one person wey dey inside di Reuters newswire miscalculate di industrial average drop as 4% go down 0.7%. E say na case of human error wey we see almost immediately and dem con correct am.

Meanwhile, some currency traders for West Germany, de talk sey de sell on top di tori, come buy am back later for higher price.

But na di wahala for Quotron kon make am dey shake.

Dillon Rifee wey be Ms. Stark talk dis one for early afternoon say she still dey look price, and oder data wey be sey de dey submit for verification, naim she con talk sey portfolio manager still dey ask di number wey dem see for screen.

Na di second time wey be sey na just one week na im e do di second time wey be sey na Quotron dey suffer when e dey calculate electricity.

For di start of trading last Wednesday, e be like sey di average person carry more dan 200 point.

Actually, na small point dat time.

One Quotron talk sey di new software wey dey im hand, maybe na im don contribute to di problem yesterday.

She say Quotron switch to backup system until di wahala wey dey shele.
