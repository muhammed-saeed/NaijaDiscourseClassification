Donald Trump wey dey face kweshon as e dey contest for American Airlines parent, AMR Corp. Even before one United Airlines buy come outside, e comot im $7.54 billion offer.

Separation, bank people wey dey di group wan buy United parent UAL corp, come meet with oder bank people on top di lower price of dat buy, maybe na around $250 per share, or $5.65 billion.

But lower bid fit face rejection by UAL board.

Oga Trump wey bin promise Wednesday to â€œgo forward wit di bid, e con dey drop am say na on top of di latest change for market condition, e say e fit sell im AMR stake, buy more shares, or buy anoda lower price.

Manhattan real-estate developer do after di UAL buyers failed to get loan on top dia earlier $300-a share bid wey cause panic for di Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Di tori be sey UAL, and AMR wey no gree open after dem sama dem on Friday for di UAL announcement, dem suspend di two stock wey dey nosedivide for composite trading on top di New York Stock Exchange.

AMR come drop $5675 to $222.875 on top of 2.3 million share, while AMR come drop $22.125 to $76.50 as 4.7 million change of hand.

Dem separate di two stocks come cause big wahala among people wey dey buy and sell inside Dow Jones Transportation Average (di quantity) wey be sey na only for October 19 1987 dem crash inside stock market.

Some say Friday market debaculate don give Oga Trump one excuse to drop offering wey show sey e dey slow down even before wahala come out wit di UAL deal.

After di day wey reach one day wey reach one hundred and seventy five naira, Trump don deny im bid as low as $97.75 last week.

Some traders don go against Oga Trump because e get record of disclossing stake for companies wey fit carry over target, den dey sell at a price without quoting.

E never still prove im mettle as big league artist, na so di airline analyst, Kevin Murphy from Morgan Stanley & Co, na im don do dis thing wey e go buy small company, con trade out.

E write dis book, di Art of di Deal, why e no just pass through one of dis tings?

Oga Trump bin dey drag im bid before di AMR board wey suppose meet tomorrow, bin weigh am down.

AMR don weigh different types of possible response from flat rejection to recapitalisation, and leverage buyout wey fit include employees, friendlier, like Texas Billionaire Robert Bass, or both.

AMR don also seek to foil Mr. Trump in Congress by lobbying for legislation wey go don strengthen di authority of di Transportation Department to reject aeroplane buyout.

Oga Trump yesterday try to blame on top sey di UAL deal on top sey e dey rush through bill to protect AMR people.

I believe sey di perception wey di law wey dey dis area may be on top of di UAL transaction, and di resulting financial market crash wey dey happen on top financial market for dis past Friday, Oga Trump don write Congress person.

AMR, no gree comment, and Oga Trump no dey gree for interview.

Oga Trump never talk how much AMR wey e buy, na only sey im holding hand na substantial, but dem buy am more dan $15 million of di stock for Sept. 20 when di price increase from di stock to $78.50.

Den and di money wey e sell for Oct. 5, dey fluctuate between di money wey be $75.625 and di money wey be $87.375.

Di attempt to persuade investors say im bid no be just "stock play", Oga Trump bin promise last week to notify market before e sell any share.

AMR dey sell around $84 yesterday before im withdrawal announcement, den immediately e fall to about $76.

Assuming sey e pay rough money of $ 80 share, and assuming sey e no sell before im talk reach market, Oga, Trump fit siddon small wit di stock of $76.50.

Some analyst say AMR Chairman Robert Crandall fit take di opportunity wey be sey di stock price drop go protect di country biggest airline wey be sey na dem dey sell stock give friendly holder, or company people.

But oder people wey know before talk sey dem believe sey Oga God, Crandall, and AMR board go fit decide to do am small, small, no add join.

Some analyst say dem believe Oga Trump wey deir tory ego don see some people as reason to believe sey e no go come back, e go come back with di lower bid.

Ray Neidl of Dillon Read & Co say Oga Trump, e dey step back dey wait for di dust to settle.

I sure sey e still wan AMR.

But oders remain skeptical, I no sure sey Donald Trump wan carry am go o, John Mattis, bond analyst with Shearson Lehmann Hutton Inc, sey di one wey happen wit United, na ogbonge way wey be sey e go bow down, Oga Trump never collect payment for im bid.

Sey dat skepticism go leave am with even more credibility wahala wey e go face as e dey return wey go stop am for any attempt to opress board for proxy fight.

Meanwhile, Citicorp, and Chase Manhattan Corp, di two main lender on di UAL buyout, come meet oda banks to see if dem go fit borrow di money to lower price.

Di oga dem wey dey inside di city don yarn sey Citicorp don discuss to reduce di money to $250 kobo, but dem yarn sey di money na to dey talk, and sey no decision don dey.

For di $250 a share, di group go borrow about $6.1 billion from di bank.

Di first UAL deal wey dem do after Citibank and Chase no fit raise $7.2 billion.

Citibank and Chase don gree to do $3 billion, say dem dey too confident to raise anoda $4.2 billion.

Citicorp and Chase collect $8 million naira to add to di money wey dem dey collect.

But oder bank wey dey sell low interest, and banking fee wey di UAL group dey pay, de dey willing to pay.

Di ofisas wey dey inside di bank yarn sey di UAL, dem dey buy out group, UAL pilot, management, and British Airways PLC sef don dey ready to pay higher bank fees, and interest, but no be sey dem go increase di $965 million equity contribution.

Di group fit no bring new sakrifice within 48 hours even if many tradas dey hope.

Di group advisers wan make sure sey dem don firm bank account for di second time around.

Even if di buy out group fit get loan, di transaction still face wahala.

DURING di new price wey de sell so, e no too dey low especially sey no competition bid dey.

Los Angeles investor, Marvin Davis, wey di $275 a-... share, na AU don reject am o, e never show show for di three three a-... share back up bid wey e make last month.

Di coalition of labour, and management, long time enemy wey dey support only Mr. Davis bid, e go fit break apart now.

Di group resilience dey start di first test today wen 30 top pilot union leaders convene outside Chicago for di first time.

Union chairman, F.C.E., Dubinsky dey for di tough work wey dem dey do on top why bank no gree finance a buy out member for di members last week.

Di pilot union dey promise to pursue acquisition anything wey di board decide.

But if di board reject bid, and decide to explore oder alternative, e fit change wetin dey work into balance for an opponent.

Di pilot fit play hardball by noting wey dem dey crucial to any sale, or restructuring because dem no fit fly aeroplane.

If dem go insist on low bid of, say $200 naira, board may not get higher offer from oder bid holders because e fit dey hard to finance a transaction wey pilots dey oppose.

Also because UAL oga, Stephen Wolf, and oder UAL executive don join di pilots bid, di board go pursue am comot make e dey fair to oder bidders.

Dat fit cost am di chance to influence wetin go happen, and maybe join di winner bidder.
