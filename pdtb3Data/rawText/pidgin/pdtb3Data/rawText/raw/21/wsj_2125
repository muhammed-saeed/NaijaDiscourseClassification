:.START

Di katakata for wall street fit make some traders dem wey wan start to dey buy demsefs, deir specialty, deir department store, investment banker, and tradas talk.

Managers for five chain don yarn now sey de wan bid for deir company.

Di shain wey dey dere na: Bloomdale wey dey owned by Campeau Corp, Toronto, Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field (wey be B.A.T Industries PLC, London) and B.Aalman & Co, and Sakowitz Inc. (wey be Hooker Corp) wey dey managed by one court appointed liquidator.)

Hooker dey for Sydney, Australia.

The number of chain wey dey for sale now, na di latest one wey don happen for dis business lBO'S (LBO'S as Miller & Rhoads Inc ), and di sudden sudden sudden increase wey investors dey face, na im go make di price, business people dey talk.

Di prices go increase more na im go help management, according to Bruce Rosenthal wey be New York investment banker with Nathan S.Janas & Co. Investers no go dey throw money give any of di proposed LBO, but to do deal on top yeye excuse no make sense.

Earlier dis year, bankers, and oder investors dey willing to provide because dem tink sey e go get big gain inside dis one wey be sey na di profit, and sales na im Oga Rosenthal add.

Dose days pass now, e believe.

Third party wey get money, and wey dey prepare to buy, na im don dey exist, and dem go continue to dey push am, but when price dey kpako, e go even hard to do one LBO. Bank people believe sey na anoder person dey always ready to pay.

Dis one no be today again.

For Saks Fifth Avenue, Paul Leblang, senior vice president, marketing, e con gree sey lower price go help im management team for deir proposed LBO.

E go help us for di search for equity partner.

To make LBO work, now we don dey go need no be sey na just jibiti wey nobody go fit take complete am, especially in B. Altman & Co wey dey under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

No be only sey di wall wall gyration na im fit make Christmas sell if consumers no too send demselves to di economy, but potential customer wey be sey dem dey demand even stronger covenant, and greater management equity.

Further, many institutions today wey be sey dey hold bad, bad money wey dey bring good money, sey de dey call am bad money wey dey bring better money, sey one retail observer, sey inison wey be sey de dey buy retail paper, na im dey worry pass.

But di low price wey de dey sell now, e go make am easy for managers to raise money wey be sey de go pay back for wetin be sey de dey buy.

Di fall wey dey sell generally, e good especially for people wey be sey dey buy cloth wey be sey de dey sell most of di revenue.

Wetin dey encourage una be sey dem go sell dis one on top dia sales, and earnings, no liquidation value, na wetin Joseph E. Brooks, wey be di chairman, and chief executive of Ann Taylor Inc, one special chain na im be sey de go get better chance to buy deir own company.

Still, most of our traders dey expect sey all di proposed retail lBOs, dem go depend on top of junk bond issue, one market wey don dey ground now for Umudu on top of jibiti wey be sey join join di bond wey be sey Federated and Allied Unit of Campeau don sama.

Shoprite price lower today pass wen e dey last week wey go help management, na Gilbert Harrison wey be di chairman for Financo Inc, one investment banker wey be sey de dey do business, but di hurdle of financing still dey.

PEOPLE wey be financial bondholder, dem go either look for greater investment on top management, or dem go insist on top di deal big pass wetin don happen before.
