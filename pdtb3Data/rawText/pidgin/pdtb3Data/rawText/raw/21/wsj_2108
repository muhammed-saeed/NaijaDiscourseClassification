Once again, your editorial page again dey break di law to conform to your almost beatificant misinformation.

In anoda little matter on top of private matter wey concern di environmental groups, Michael S. Greve tell you sey di clean water act na on top presumptuous, rather than na zero risk e go do, e go establish a legal standard of zero discharge (na congressive, Buccane, Sept. 18).

Dis statement surely, buttress your editorial viewpoint sey environmental protection na generally yeye tins, or na just wrong.

Di clean water act no get "legal standard" of zero discharge.

Dem dey call am “discharge of pollutants ” wey dey enter water for United States permit wey be sey na under section 301 di law dey talk about.

Any which which may be di problem for dis system, e scarcely dey show zero risk, or zero discharge.

E fit be sey Oga, Gree confuse for Congress statement on top nationwide goal, in section 101 wey even call for di elimination of discharge by 1985, no be small.

Dem no take dis yeye statement serious wen dem do am for 1972 and make dem no confuse am with di operative provision wey dey di law.

So you dey do one kind big work wen Oga Greve talk sey even toh di Clean Water Act sey di preparation of scotch, and water, your tipping people fit lead dem to believe sey noting na chance, or oversight dey protect dem as dem dey waka for night with deir scotch, and water from di hairyknuckles wey dey inside di Sierra Club.
