Di iron, and marble lobby of Centrust bank, na im big pass for your average savings, and loan.

One tin be sey, one old oga wey dey on top wall, Samuel Anointing David, one big canvas wey Mattia Preti, wey dey for di 17th century, dey dere.

But di painting now, na gbogbo, gbo, gbo, gbo, gbo, gbo, gbo, gbo, gbo, gbo, gbo, gbo, gbo, gbo, gbo, gbo, gbo, gbo, gbo, gbo.

For one international buying spree wey start just two years ago, Oga Paul Amassed get about 30 pre-1800 work, including di Preti, at di total cost of $28 million.

By midnight, Oct. 6, all di paintings suppose be sold under Florida comptroller wey dey office dey regulate state S&L.

Porcius Fest no meet deadline.

Di collection dey for one grandiose plan, Oga God, Paul get am for mind sey di art go do times two if na sirious investment for Kentrust and to dekorate S&L new office tower, wey I.M. Pei design.

Di rub be sey dem plok $28 million from di funds of dis federally insured institution even as Centrust dey lose money on top of fist.

Oga Paul no get right to buy art for S&L for di first place. E no dey di comptroller's list, e no find special dispensation wey e no do.

Apart from dis one, some painting wey be sey de dey do good for Pent Rut, de con hang for chairman house for La Gorce Isle, for Miami Beach.

Last month, di comptroller office call a halt to Mr. Paul fling give am six months to sell di paintings.

Di acquisition, officials in a letter to Mr. Paul, dem be "unsafe, no sound, no unauthorized", so far, Mr. Paul don unlock three of im masterpiece, e no go tell who e be.

Di comptroller office talk sey e dey monitories di situation, but di agency fit remove Mr. Paul, but e no get any plan to do dat one.

No be sey dem dey sell Chevrolet, Oga Paul talk sey as e dey drag for one goldbanded St. Moritz cigarette, di last six months don establish di quality of di collection.

Fire no dey here.

Despite Mr. Paul character, di 50 years old, chain smoking dynamo, e don dey see sey to enter Centrust, Florida biggest thrift institution, out of its risky investment, e dey hard to enter inside.

Words are just part of di picture.

Although Mr. Paul don keep $1.35 billion ontop bad bond portfolio to less dan $900 million since April, di high number debt market don fall.

Di remaining tins wey remain under di new Federal S&L bailout law, may be hard o.

And Centrust get oder wahala.

Last week, federal regulators bin don give orda sey make di thrift bank stop to dey pay dividend on top of im preferred stock, a move wey be sey e dey worry for one institution.

Oga Paul don plan to sell down 63 of Centrust 71 branches, but e never get approval from regulators.

But na Oga Paul art venture na im don attract investors, regulators, people wey be sey de no dey talk gallery for di whole world.

Visitable shareholders (some of dem wey dey sue), dem talk sey di chairman, and collection epitomize di excess speculation wey come make di National S&L crisis, come fall from high of $15.125 for 1986 to close close yesterday at $2.875. Meanwhile, gallery directors, meanwhile, dem talk sey Oga, Paul, and some of im ilk don leave mark wey no good for di world.

Dem no talk sey na van Gog dey again, dem talk sey na di president of Wildenstein & Co, one New York gallery, dem talk sey, “Johnny Payson collect $53 million for im head, so surely $10 million no too much for my head! The big people wey we dey depend on, na dem dey stop to buy, and di new customers na men wey dey sell stock market, or dey collect collect money.

When Mr. Paul enter art market, e let people know sey no piece of di art dey too expensive for person to consider for Centrust.

E establish im name as freespender for January last year for Sotheby auction of di Linda, and Gerald Guterman collection for New York.

For dere, for one of im first shopping trip, Oga Paul carry many painting wey fine well, well.

Im pay $2.2 million (tan yan, yan, yan, yan) for one still life wey dem dey call Jan Jansz and dat one na maybe $700,000.

Di money wey dem dey sell na di artist own (na about 64% of wetin dem dey sell for Guterman auction na di average of $343,333).

Di rest, de withdrawn because of no acceptable bid. Afterward, Mr. Guterman talk sey im don phone Mr. Guterman, di New York developer wey dey sell di collection, and collect money.

E say e go stole dem, e go tell me sey if you wan see your painting, you go come my house for Florida. 'Mr. Paul deny to dey fay, and dey gi-... e just dey fay, e just dey gi-... e just dey gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... gi-... g

Oga Paul kwik-kwik start to dey vex wen e dey collect tins from am and na sotey e follow one old oga wey e meet for one show wey dem dey call Guterman item.

Mr. Wachter wey be im principal adviser, come dey search gallery for London, Paris, Monaco.

And according by one dealer, Mr. Wachter get penchant say e go give Mr. Paul, and di phrase na, e go fit buy anyting.

Nikolas Hall, president of Colnaghi U.S.a Ltd, New York, na im sell Mr. Paul, and Sarah for Wilderness by Giovanni Batistista Tiepolo.

Mr. Hall talk Oga Paul sey dem know am well, well.

People dey see am, but de know sey di road na Sotey, especially George Wachter.

Mr. Paul con become close symbiotic relationship with Sotheby.

Oga Paul dey always get time wey e go do dis one wey be sey na for di headquarter, CenTrust branch office na im dey carry am go for di insider part of di year wey dey pass.

Sotheby, di auction house wey dem build for London, 1744, now under Sotheby Holdings Inc umbrella, e dey hope to attract old oga dem as e dey try to build U.S. business.

European traders continue to dey dominate di action for di old ogas wey Soteters North America don dey shook for dis country.

For many months, everybody come dey do ologboranganda.

Last October, Mr. Paul pay $12 million of Centrust cash plus $1.2 million commission for Portrait of a Man as Mars, di painting wey dem dey call Flemish artist Peter Rubens, dem buy am privately through Sotheby auction.

For March 1989, just 15 months for im campaign, Oga God, dem dey call am Art & Specium, one of di highest paid collectors for di U.S.A. Dem talk sey e no dey stop to paint on top canvas, but e dey do big-big ting wey you fit use eat. E recently sell $30,000 give one Paris charity auction wey six of di world top chefs dey do, but di last one cost well well.

Paul talk sey no be dat one high pass.

Di art collection for maybe don rival di Medics office wen Florida comptroller office no hear word of Mr. Paul aesthetic adventure.

For di letter wey e send am, wey dey March 2 dey share with tori people, Alex Hager wey be di oga of di thriftinstitution bureau for di comptroller office, dey yarn sey e fit dey sopraiz person wen e don lose more than $13 million inside di two preceding quarter.

Di state give KEN Trust 30 days to sell Rubens.

Di comptroller office, eventually extend di date to six months, e con dey demand make dem increase di money wey be sey de dey drop drop for di collection beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh beh h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h

Di state oblique talk sey unsafe banking practice na grounds for person to take comot one officer, or director come close wit di advice wey dem give Oga God Paul sey make e take do im own accordingly.

Di state agency dey very, very vex when dem find out sey di Rubins, and half of di paintings wey dey inside di bank account, na im dem hang for chairman house o.

Oga Paul talk sey at one point, e get eight, or nine of di paintings for house, and di rest dey for Soteter own.

E explain sey na only for house na im e dey keep di paintings, because of di special dehumidisation environment wey be sey de must keep dem, until di Centrust new building don ready for dem.

Still, di matter, na embarrassment.

It came on top of many local newspaper wey dey yarn sey Oga Paul don gain fine thing from im gombodi with Centrust.

For example, e collect $3 million loan from S&L, e negotiate am low market rate.

E get 43% of wetin dey inside di Centrust share.

Adding to Mr. Paul palava, tradas (some wit oga patapata) insist sey e too put too much ear for di advice wey Sotheby give am, e pay well, well for many pieces for di Centrust collection.

For example, di $12 million wey di artist dey pay, na im dem dey sell am give people wey dey mold am, and maybe times two, dem dey drag am go meet people wey know about am.

David Tunick wey be president of David Tunick Inc, New York gallery dey yarn o sey scholars dey torchlight di authenticity of Rubins.

Rubens associate paint am instead of am.

Di way wey many people wey dey sell business side be sey di money wey de dey sell at dat time, e too much for any event o, Oga Tunick talk sey e be like Rubins wey e carry go di cleaners.

Victor Wiener wey be di executive of di Appraisers Association of America, na im talk sey Oga Paul don pay very much for di Rubins, and e add sey e go soon finish di Rubins, sey di Rubins go sell am for $12 million even if sey dem go sell am for dat amount next month.

Still, to dey predict dey tricky o, wetin I dey see for dis high price na jibiti.

Jonatan H. Kress wey be di former owner of di painting, Mrs. Rush Kress, e dismiss di price say na "sour grapes", traders wey dey sell di paint, e talk sey dem, dem dey put eye for di price wey dem dey sell Rubin, but dem lost.

Oga Paul dey defend Rubens price, e talk sey many experts never see di thing by imsef, sey most of dem no even born di last time wey dem do di painting for open place.

Artefact dey price for sky, but one betta legerdemain dey price for market matter.

Salomon Brothers Inc., di investment bank account wey dey always dey return, dem talk sey di old oga dem like 51% for di year wen dem close for June 1 akordin to wetin dey dia hand, no be only 13 tins wey dey dia hand na im dey carry am go, even though sey na 74% dem dey get from Sotheby.

Solomon dey get plenty money from people like Soteter wey dey sell things give dem like Mr. Paul for di Treasury Market.

Many picture wey many people dey draw dey go auction.

Art index no dey favour pe o.

But dem nor dey sell art wey don spoil.

Also, at any of Sotheby auction, about one percent of wetin dey sell, no dey sell at any price.

No be sey bid no dey, but di bid no dey di minimum wey di sellers dey set.

For January, di Preti painting wey hang for Centrust suppose bring no more dan $700,000 until Oga, Paul come wit im $1.15 million.

Mr. Hall of Colnaghi gallery say one million for impossible price for Preti four years ago, but from now on, no be sey Oga, Paul, one customer of im own, e go pay for di work, gargantuan painting wey artist no dey do house, na 10 feet wide, na seven feet high na im di painting don change.

Oga Paul dey boast sey e see market for old oga dem just before de con turn up, de con climb go up 51% last year, and de go do am again dis year, e con talk sey de dey sleep.

Everybody dey go buy Monet, Soby Vice President, Diana Levitt say di auction house don dey assist Oga Paul to sell di paintings.

And while Sotheby chief rival for di art world, private artist, no happy to hear am, she con talk sey de don sell am, and de don sell am big, big money. Oga Paul talk sey e don sell three painting, but e don sell pass ten percent of di profit.

Dat one no be 51% and di claim no be documented.

E further deny sey im too too much for Soteby, or Mr. Wachter.

Oga Paul talk sey im no get one, na four advisers, and im no dey ever bid like dat.

After all, e get advice of "curator wey dey among the most respected museum in di world", e con dey expect sey e go sell di collection, even di controversial Rubins, sey dey take care of am well, well as de bin put am together.

But for art world parlour, Oga Paul hand, na burnt na im be sey e dey come market too soon, and e don get offer wey no be sey e pay am some of di art work, after some years, you go fit argue sey aha na natural appreciation.

But quick turnover for artworks, like pawning your jewelries, you end up wit 50%.

People dey hold price, de dey try price.

Sotheby don defend imsef, and Oga Paul for di matter.

Oga wachter talk sey Oga, Paul na one sharp, sharp study wey e do, e buy di best picture wey dey dere, and e say on occasion e pay big money, Oga wachter concede, but e talk sey di people wey no pay, na people wey go later mark di paintings to sell give collector.

Naomi Bernhard Levinson, one madam wey dey Bernhard Associates for San Francisco dey reason sey na kworel dey give customers for one auction house wey dey sell, and dey price paintings to buy. Sotheby, she con talk sey na she go wear only hat.

E say I no fit see why katakata go dey shekele, katakata according to Sotheby, Ms. Levitt. Estonia dey base on di former price of similar works wen dey sell, and current market condition, and e no dey affect anybody wey di potential buyer be. Often, clients dey bring di paintings come, but dem no dey sell am, she con add sey so we no know who di potential buyer go be.

Oga Paul, dey sell painting, de dey find at least 15% on top di bank investment so dat e go show sey di artwork dey okay.

Oga Paul talk sey im get mind for di whole world, and potential buyers from far, far Japan, and Italy don look di collection.

Because of di pressure wey dey on top Centrust to sell, business men and collectors don dey try to buy painting for price wey dey low.

But so far Mr. Paul, and im advisers dey hold fast.

One dealer, Martin Zimet of French & Co, for New York, e say e for like buy Jan Davids de Heem painting from bank, I try to thief di picture, buy am fine, and seleby no go do am.

De dey protect imself.

Meanwhile, Oga Paul, and Centrust executives, de just dey para on top of opulence.

Mr. Paul don describe himself as di Great Gatsby, or someting, complains Karen E. Brinkman, wey be di executive vice president of Centrust.

Media, she talk, de don do am wayo for im life.

Mr. Paul no gree, I no tink sey I get di kind life wey be sey frankly, so flamboyant, e dey talk.

But just dat moment, one savant for Tuxedo wey dey pour coffee, silva for inside China cup, and dey drop di bribe wey dey inside linen.

Oga Paul talk sey, di ceiling for en executive suite, na gold leaf inlay.

Office dey do wood, and oriental rugs, and of course book wey get leather, and of course na $12 million rubins.

But e fool una sey, ‘God glory dey fade.’ ”

No talk sey na gold ceiling.

Just say office don appoint, e say oderwise, regulators go take am tay, and now everything don dey perfect.

Depending on di tax, or transaction, e no dey cost.
