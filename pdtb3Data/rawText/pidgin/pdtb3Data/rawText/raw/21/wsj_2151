Sitanslav Ovcharenko wey be di Russia aeroplane for here, see some kind vision wey skata according to wetin dey happen now.

For im office wey dey near di runway for Shannon Airport, Oga Ovcharenko dey jump up and down wetin e dey call just idea.

E first talk sey GPA Group Ltd, one international airline wey dey for Ireland, go rent some of im jet plane to Soviet airline.

Den Aer Lingus wey be di Irish flag carrier, fit teach aeroplane and di Boeing plane make e dey fly, and di fleet fit dey for Shannon Airport.

E say na noting be dat.

Oneer Rianta, di Irish airport authority, e fit build cargo terminal for Soviet Union.

Eroflot fit borrow some of im cargo go Aer Lingus through GPA for one joint flight.

Afta dat one, e kon tink of one small ship wey dem dey koll Irish Solsol, wey dey carry Armenian pipol go Los Angeles thru Shannon.

Glassnost freedom don go give Oga Ovcharenko?

Hardworking.

Di jet wey dey inside di jet dey alive, and well, well for Shannon Airport.

GpA dey talk sey dem dey lease West plane to Aeroplane, and even sey dem dey buy Soviet build Tupolev 204.

Aer Lingus dey talk wit di Soviet gorment about cargo, and oder possibilities.

Aer Rianta don do plenty business already wit Aeroflot wey im chief executive dey read Russian.

But dis one no be small one o, as e be sey na small, small, na Communist Ireland na im don enter inside the big, big Soviet airline bureau.

And as aeroplane dey struggle to increase service, upgrade service, and dey pursue commercial opportunities, di Irish aviation industry be like sey e go boost.

Irish, and Soviet, de dey look di same ting.

Dem be very friendly ah, ah even yarn sey dis Irish company na small, but spinky o, sey we must study deir experience well, well, sey we must find any way to take dey do business, sey di two group don dey do business together since di 1970 taim wey be sey Soviet joint venture na di rage for West Africa.

Aeroflot wey carry about 125 million passengers last year, and Shannon Airport, wey be di largest airport outside di Soviet Union, see 1,400 aeroplane, and 250,000 passengers dey pass through.

E pass 130 aeroplane and flight attendants wey dey inside the building wey dey on top of di road.

Di biggest airport fuel, na Soviet Union e dey sell pass.

Tankers wey dey Latvia port of Ventspils every year dey carry 25 million gallons of fuel enter one special tank farm for airport.

Ehn aeroplane no dey put im own fuel tanker, Ilyushins dey enter airport authority wey dey sell am to 11 Western Airlines, including Air France, Trans World Airlines, and Pakistan International Airlines.

â€œAeroflot dey pay im money wen e reach ground, e dey buy fuel, e dey maintain di money wey e get.

Dat one no be.

Last year, di Irish airport authority for one joint venture wey dem dey call Aeroflot, come open four hard currency duty free shops for Moscow wey be Sheremetyevo Airport.

Aer Rianta now, e dey sell duty free on top all aeroplane international flight wey dey come Moscow.

E get some free shops wey dey Leningrad's Pulkova Airport for Judah and hard currency shops for Leningrad, plus di Soviet-Finnish boundary wey dey near dem.

Aer Rianta dey talk about di same joint venture wey dey Tashkent, and Sochi for Black Sea resort, and even one machine wey dey cook with Georgian city of Tbilisi.

For Shannon Airport, dem dey paint Aeroflot international plane wey reach 285.

Thanks to a new air traffic agreement, and the ability of Irish travel agent to issue aeroplane ticket, visitors here dey use reasonable price take enter aeroplane for holiday for Havana, Kingston, and Mexico City.

Di roundtrip to Havana na 410 Irish punts ($578).

Jamaica cost 504 punt.

Afta sometaim, Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev stop to dey talk with di Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey.

Dem sign new deal.

All of dem start with geography.

For 1939, Shannon start to fly come from Europe for di first time wey plenty aeroplane dey fly for North America.

Dat time now, aeroplane and plane wey get fuel tanker don stop to dey fly for most western airplane, but aeroplane still dey fly for di most efficient Ilyushin wey fit make di plane from Moscow to Managua on one hop.

Afta dem shoot one Korean Airliner over di sea for 1983, even though sey na suspended direct Moscow-Shannon flights for two months.

In fact, Aer Lingus start to dey enter Russia from Shannon to New York when Washington strip aeroplane rights for U.S. landing right.

Aer Rianta dey make big money today from di Soviet friendship.

And with di contact wey dey dere, e go dey very simple to add Aer Lingus, and GPA join di team.

Den maybe Oga Ovcharenko own, e no go sound like dat blasphemy.
