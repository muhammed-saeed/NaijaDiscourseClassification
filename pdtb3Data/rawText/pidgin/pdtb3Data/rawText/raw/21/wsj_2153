When Nucor Corp begin dey send steel from di world first thin slab come dis month, e go begin dey test di rival wey get power pass.

Di new technology wey dey make one thin piece of steel, dey reduce di price of flat sheet.

Anoda ebullant Kenneth Iverson wey be Nucor chairman talk sey, eventually, company plant go make one ton of steel in 1.5 hours compared to four to six hours for one conventional mill.

We don get Russian, Chinese, and people from India wey dey come visit us, Oga Iverson beam, everybody for di world dey eye us well, well.

Especially im neighbours, di major U.S. steel maker.

Elready, USSR, and Armco Inc, de dey study Nucor technology to see wheder de fit adopt am.

Di chief executive of one major Midwest steel company talk sey na damn water leak.

Di once shack wey dey dere is about to be turned topsypsy by a 1990 technology revolution.

New, modern, and advanced technology dey make am easy for small, small, small company to make aluminium for di fraction of wetin Big Steel don dey sell for many years.

E still allow small-small pipol make dem buy wetin dem dey sell for di flat steel market. Di big man wey dem dey sell for market naim big pass, but till today, nobody fit buy am at-all.

But dat thin slab technology, na only di beginning.

Pioneers wey be engineer dey try to dey do direct work, dey use am dey do direct work. By by dis time of 1990, comot coke oven, and dey hot wey be sey dey hot well, well.

All dis big house wey dey for up, wey cost well-well and wey get wahala, dey lock all di big house wey dem make with iron.

E get one revolution ahead of us wey go eventually change di way we dey market, and distribute steel. Dis na wetin William Dennis, wey be vice president for American Iron Ore, and Steel Institute talk.

No be sey big iron company come dey ignore high technology.

In fact, de don spend billions of dollars to boost di percentage wey be sey de don cast steel to 60.9% for 1988 from 39.6% for 1988.

Also, deir paper dey ekwol, deir old leaf dey lock, and deir workers dey lean.

But dat one no go suffice, no be only to flog di guy down di street.

You get to beat everybody around di world,‚Äù na so Oga Dennis tok.

E wan see steel maker wey dey do computer, and artificial intelligence.

Di problem be sey de don saddle dem wit big, big plant wey dey chop expensive maintenance.

Make una try to get new money for market wey dey soft and strong dollar and make una dey karry heavy money and propaty wey una dey sell give oda pipol.

Technology go begin to dey threaten very, very people wey be established producer, Peter Marcus wey be analyst for PaineWeber Inc talk sey de don too invest inside di old stuff, and de no fit get deir workers to dey flexible.

Nobody expect sey small space go dey to eclipse big iron wey be sey na only one king wey be sey, na im get all di right wey we get to use take repair car and refrigerator.

Nokor's plant wey dey for Crawfordsville, Ind go produce only one million kiln a year, di 40 million kilin ton-a-year flat steel bucket, and e go last years before e go competition for di high market.

Still, flat-fit na di steel industry bread, and butter wey be sey na about 80 million tons for di steel wey go dey come dis year.

Further, di process no dey get headache at all.

Because all operation dey connected, one equipment failure, complete plant shutdown.

Some days, Nucor no dey produce anyting.

At dis point, minimal power no go make great dent in integrated market, but e dey challenge dem to develop new market, says James McCartney, Vice President, materials, at Battelle, one technology, and management consultant wey dey for Columbus, Ohio.

The truth be sey, person wey dey make iron no go quick get power, sotey e go need to change how e take dey do business.

Armco chief economist, John Corey, steel makers don do one product come out on top loading dock say we say: "We get product, if you want am, you fit buy am, na now we dey know wetin people need, and we dey go back to make am."

Armco sales representative visit General Motors Corp. Fakefax Assembly plant for Kansas City, Mo, two, three days a week.

When de decide say GM need part more quickly, Armco say make e build service centre wey dey near so dat de go fit deliver within 15 minutes.

E no be small work wey we dey do to make sure sey we dey do wetin go save us, especially when we dey rely on small company wey be sey dey supply wetin we dey sell, especially sey dem dey buy wetin we dey sell for market, dey find wetin we go sell for market, especially sey dem dey find wetin we go sell for small price, dey call rubber, and aluminium.

For example, when Detroit begin talk about car wey get rubber, American Iron and Steel Institute, start to dey do big, big lobbying to show dem how dem go take use steel more efficiently, simply change how dem take dey arrange car door.

But people wey dey do iron, de must find new market.

After dem allow aluminium make e dey lead, one group wey big pass for di country start to dey use aluminium take dey give people wey be sey na dem get right to use am.

Let Battelle's Oga McLain think sey make steel people concentrate on top more work o.

For example, weirton Steel Corp, weirton W. Va. For example, e dey market people wey dey buy new house, wey dem dey call leaded glass, so dat dem go fit use am well, well, instead of wood or aluminium.

Other people wey dey build the house for inside na steel.

Still oders dey look Oyinbo market.

SUSS dey push di drilling pipe to di steel, and di Soviet Union.

Dis year, di largest steel wey di country get, na im dem add join di overseas sales waka.

Pioneers too dey focus on top higher profit output like coated, and electrogalvanized products wey remain small, small.

Almost all di capital improvement programme wey major steel company don announce before dis year na to build electrogalvanizing line, wey be sey na dem dey produce am like house, electric, and car door.

But unfortunately, dat segment small pass di bread and Butter flat iron, e be like sey everybody wey dey climb from QE II enter lifeboat, na im John Jacobson wey be one analyst with AUS consultants talk sey after some time now, person must go on top side, even though sey e no expect any bankrupting, e dey see more plant wey dem dey sell or wey dem dey sell.

Robert Crandall, Brookings Institute, na im dey yarn sey except di economic growth, or further downing of di dollar, di amount of U.S. steel wey be sey de don produce enough steel to offset di growth of little tin.

Make una no talk about incurry importation.

Japan and European steel company wey dey among the people wey dey do wetin dey happen for Russia for 1992 dey worry about how dem go take do business if dem go do am for Japan and Europe.

And U.S. dey expect more competition from low cost wey be sey dey produce Pacific Rim, and Latin America.

One Taiwanese steel maker now, e just announce plan to build one Nucor-like plant.

People dey see di steel business as old, and ordinary smokestack business, na im de don die.
