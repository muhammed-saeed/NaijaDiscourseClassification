As di sponsor of di "Older Americans Freedom to Work Act", wey go comot Social Security earnings for people wey be sey dey old, and old, I dey commend you for your strong endorsement to comot dis Depression era fossil.

For every dollar wey be sey de win over 8,880, social security benefit, de lose 50 cent for deir social security benefit, e be like sey na like 50 percent.

But di compounding effects of Senior only, tax matter, na im dey bring true, true tax.

Think am sey one widow want continue to dey live for di same level wey e dey before when e go pay big money wey be sey na tax wey dey owe, na im e go pay pass.

Even though sey na only two times this widow dey collect, because of di money wey e dey collect, e go get anoda $4,930 wey be sey na four hundred and thirty shekel.

E go reduce money limit, e go help old, and down.

New tax go increase inside more dan government go lose on top increased social security benefit.

We need to support Democrats on top di Rules Committee to include earnings limit reform for di Reconciliation Bill.

Since all four people wey dey di committee, na cos of my bill, na di Democrats go hold well if di earnings test amendment no go dey from floor.

Di time na now to lift di heavy load on top social security level from back of our nation senior.
