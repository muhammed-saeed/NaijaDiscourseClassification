Di oga patapata of di Exchequer Nigel Lawson don do one kind financial policy to prevent freefall for sterling sterling since last week.

But analyst talk sey di chancellor failure to announce any new policy wey dey inside im Mansion House last Thursday, don weaken di support for sterling.

Dis one don increase di risk of government to increase base rate to 16% from deir current 15% to defend di pound, economists, and foreign exchange analyst talk.

Free trade matter dey go different side, but few economists dey expect sey data go show sey dis one wey be sey de bin report for August, show sey dis one wey be sey de don increase well, well.

August deficit and di #2.2 billion gap wey dem register for July na only di #2.3 billion billion deficit for October 1988.

Sanjay Joshi wey be European economist for Baring Brothers & Co, na im talk sey no sign sey Britain dey take dey transform imsef to boost export.

E go say di current account wey dey account go narrow to only #1.8 billion in September.

But Oga Dillow talk sey im believe sey if dem reduce how dem take dey produce wetin dem dey sell for market, sey di thing go sharp, sharp drop for import.

Combined with at least some rebound in export after August, di deficit go reduce as little as #1.3 billion.

Mr. Briscoe wey dey also forecast about di #1.3 billion naira current account gap, dey yarn sey even if di currency bullish for sterling, di currency no go move well, well because investors go want see further evidence of di turnaround before dem go adjust.

But e no talk sey person go wan enter business o, no be sey de wan enter market o, no be sey de wan enter market o.

Meanwhile, overall evidence on di economy remain clouded.

For im Mansion House talk, Oga Lawson come warn sey oda slow down wey be sey de don dey fall on top di last level wey be sey de don dey fall on top interest level since last month.

U.K. base rate dey highest for di eight years.

But consumer expenditure data wey dey comot Friday no suggest sey di U.K. economy just dey slow like dat now.

Di figures show sey to dey spend from third quarter to second quarter, na up to three percent from last year.

Dis one dey compare a 1.6% increase inside di second quarter, and 5.4% increase inside di second quarter of 1988.

Oga Dillow yarn sey di data wey dey show di economy still strong, but suggestion sey many of di buying, na service, no be consumer goods, make dem reduce deir fear of more importation.

True, true, di chancellor don make am clear sey e dey ready to increase interest rate again if e be sey e go reduce wetin dey happen and sey sterling no go continue again.

On Thursday, e remind im audience sey government no fit allow necessary rigor of money policy to weak by exchange rate.

Analyst pipol don gree sey small tin dey hold dem small now pass Oga God Lawson wey talk sey de go push am go up small if necessary.

And de warn any more drop wey government go dey popular, e fit kpako kpako kpako.
