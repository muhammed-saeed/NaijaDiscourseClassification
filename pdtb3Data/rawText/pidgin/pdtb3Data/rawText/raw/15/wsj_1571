In finding correct news for Berkeley new freshman plan, di privile class, editorial, Sept. 20, you dey read di headline, but no be di tori.

Di plan even raise from 40% to 50% di number of freshmen applicants wit respect to academic criteria.

But dat one no mean sey half of di students wey dey go Berkeley, de go dey admitted like dat.

Di plan dey talk about applicants, no be students wey dey register.

Sey di one wey get di highest number of applicants, na im dey very low, de admit am from 40%, to 50% give di registrants from about 31% to 38% of di class.

In addition, maybe 5% of registrants go come from new category wey include applicants wey be sey dem pass school mark, e go miss dem for di first category.

But against dat combined increase of 12% for students wey dey do academics, di plan eliminate big category wey be sey admission now, na grade, test scores, supplementary point for factors like high school, English, and essay.

Dis category now, na about 19% of admission, and 22% of registrants.

Di plan now go reduce by 22%, for net of 10%, di number of students na according to academic criteria.

Who go take dis place?

Di plan create new category of students from Socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, one concept wey never define, and give dem about 10% of di class.

One of di plan authors don defend di Socioeconomic disadvantage wey be sey maybe e make sense pass di current affirmative action wey dey on top of race.

E get wetin e dey do.

But di new category no replace, or reduce Berkeley area wey big pass.

No be admission students from racial minority group wey dey admitted through di new category go count against di affirmative action target for deir group.

Di plan den put up a huge new affirmative action on top of di existing programme on top of race.

Whether person go school to choose Berkeley new person, na only academic condition go dey affect am.
