DON SIZING UPON di risk of stock market investment, may be sey no opening place better pass beta, but investors better still keep am in mind.

Beta na one small gauge wey dey measure stock, or stock mutual fund.

If any change for di overall market, e go mean sey di particular issue go come up, or e go fall.

E get many people wey you know, and e dey easy to understand.

Di beta of broad market, wey dem dey call Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, na always 1.0.

So stock wey get beta of 0.5, na half of di volatile, one at 1.5, na 50% of di volatile, and so on.

Clear investors should generally go take stocks wey get low beta.

“Make yu go buy strong broda wey get money well-well for inside oda tins.

Remember sey dat beta also get important limitations, but beta is only part of di risk in stock, says William F. Sharpe, di Stanford University emeritus professor wey con take measure, sey e get risk wey no be sey de dey associated wit market move, and di beta no tell you how much.

For example, beta no dey measure di company, and industry specific risk associated with one stock.

Dat “business ” risk dey very important for investor wey be sey only few stocks dey, but virtually, dem go disappear for big, big, and different portfolio.

Beta na also poor indicator of risk for stock group wey dey march to deir own drummer.

Di gold and silva for gold dey weak evriday, but di tins wey dey der, dey weak, bikos dem dey move anyhow.

But about di matter, investors fit misinterpret all dose kind reading wey lead di American Association of Individual Investors to eliminate beta fund, for 1989 edition of di Mutual Fund Guide.

We dey fear sey people go just look di beta of one gold fund, say here na investment wit very low risk," na John Markese, wey dey research for di Chicago based group o sey, in reality na very volatile but no be because of market movement.
