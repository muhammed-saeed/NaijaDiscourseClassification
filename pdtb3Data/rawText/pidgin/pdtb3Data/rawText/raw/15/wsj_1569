YOU don go university, you don tink sey you go go school.

Now you don discover sey you never learn di main lesson o, how to send your pikin go university.

Truly, when you go university, no much to learn.

Put some money for intrest wey you dey spend on interest account, dey watch am grow.

Now, investment sales people talk sey time don reach to take some kind risk if you wan get di kind returns wey go buy your toddler give Presido U for 18 years.

Make una trowey di passbook, make una waka enter glory.

Di reason na money.

Nothing for di Analal, wey dey teach, wey dey reach 1980.

School fees for private universities increase 154% for di 10 years wey be dis year, na double di 77% increase for consumers during di same period.

A year for Harvard now na $19,395.

For 2007, when dis year wey dem just born for campus, four years Ivy League sheep go cost $300,000, give or take pizza with everytin for exam time.

Tanford, Mutso, and oder tings no go dey dear.

So wetin be parent to do?

Some investment adviser dey suggest in effect on a start up investment pool maybe on di margin.

Some dey prefer deep one, zerocoupon bond.

But odas still sey, “Why una tink sey una fit get high octane growth fund?”

You no go do am for 5% bank account, says James Riepe, wey be director of mutual fund at T. Rowe Price.

To get di necessary growth, Murray Ruffel, wey be marketing officer for di Financial Programmes mutual fund fund group, you need to go stock market.

As in small jara, e no dey pain.

No dey worry anybody, dat is except sey di growth fund no dey grow wen you need am.

Or zerocoupon bond wey you dey find so, no dey price your pikin school well, well.

Na im di problem for today mama o.

Even dough many experts dey advise person about risk, nobody go fit give you better answer if di risk no pay.

Help dey come.

Antitrust division for di Justice Department dey torchlight di oda similar school fees, and e dey increase for top schools.

Fake religion fit cool body come out for 1990.

And den State U.

But for papa and mama, to dey go school well, well, dey sweet dem small, sotey na so-so yeye tins dey sweet dem for dia shidren.

Just dey conscious of public concern, lawmakers, and financial middle people dey do overtime to create, and sell university savings, and investment scheme.

Deir message, weda na exp, weda na university go cost so much by anytime wey you want am say di try, and true, no go dey do again.

Get about bill, or money market fund.

New wave of marketing na instruction.

Some outfit like, di Financial Programme, Franklin, and T. Rowe Price mutual fund fund groups, and Edward D. Jones broder house, na dem dey advertise brochure, and chart wey dey tell you how much you go keep every time.

Di calculation dey usually depend on after tax wey dey return 8% every year, na only one place, di stock market dey available.

Most of di mailers na free, but Denver based financial programme dey sell, for $15 akordin to di age of di pikin and di university of choice.

Di figures dey shocking.

To build nest egg wey Stanford go dey pay wen she don dey reach university, parents go dey keep $773,94 a month for 12 years.

De fit cut dis to six91.09 a month if di investing dey go university.

And de can further reduce monthly money if de start to dey save earlier, when mama, and pikin dey come back from hospital.

Traveling cheap college to di formula still no dey generate one installment wey most people fit live wit.

T. Rowe Price plan na $450 monthly if di plan start when di pikin dey six years.

As e be sey di formula assume na 8% on mutual fund, na $16,500 e go pay for di 12 years.

No be everybody dey do somisticistic, person dey para well, well, na so Arthur Bauman wey be consultant to American Council on Education for Washington talk.

E dey take issue of projections wey no dey factor for student contribution, wey dey reduce most parent load well, well.

Still, im dey yarn sey no be bad ting if all di marketing proda leave small ting. Di situation wey you want avoid, na person wey no go save anytin, and hope sey e go fit do am out of current income, na madam.

Im advice be sey, no panic.

Parents, e dey talk sey make dem aim every kain regular investment wey dem fit afford.

E add join di money wey di investment table dey suggest, sey na correct goal.

Like dat, parent go reduce borrowing, and outlay from current income when time come to pay school fees.

Mr. Bauman talk sey di best investment wey person fit make now, na mutual fund, because as e take be manage, and as time dey go, na almost get wetin dey di stock average.

E dey favor big big fund, or big big fund wey dey mix wetin get space, join am to make am strong.

But for deir mind, parents, and oder universitybenefactors dem, de dey follow new scheme.

Dem don launch about $1 billion for so called baccalaureate zerocoupon municipal bond, so far Connecticut, Illinois, Virginia and eight oda states dem don offer.

And de don buy about $500 million for prepaid transportation plan wey dey come for Michigan, Florida, Wyoming.

Di prepaid plan dey take payment today, usually na im de dey pay school, or na small money na im de dey promise sey school go cover tomorrow.

Di baccalaureate bond (dem dey call am tax), for small denomination, and usually provision wey person no go call am before im big, e be like sey na tailor wey person dey do for university saver.

Like oder zero, de dey pay all deir interest to maturity so dat person wey dey sell fit make deir bond only when junior dey secondary school.

Deir compounding effect na also deir own o.

For June, Virginia sell bond of $268.98 wey go pay $1,000 for 2009

But Richard Anderson, wey be di Forum for College Financing Alternatives, for Columbia University, one research group wey Federal Government don finance, talk sey zeros dey very, very weak.

Dem dey price pass any oder bond when inflation, and intrest rate start.

Dat one no go happen if de don reach adult, but if, for any reason, di parents go sell am before dat time, e fit be sey de lose principal well, well.

Had zero zero for 1972, and had parents bought face value of four years to achieve deir children's registration, for only two years, Mr. Anderson dey figure.

But most oda bond, e go don't hold well, well.

prepaid money na good thing o provided sey your future school go dey secure.

Di government dey generally limit wetin dem go take guarantee state institutions, but buyers dey collect money wey dem no go pay if di children no go di specified schools.

Two private group dey find di Securities and Exchange Commission approval on top plans wey fit be more transferable.

Oga Anderson wan make di prestige college dey support dat kind plan.

Di matter here fit be di soundness of di guarantee.

Payment, many like mutual fund, na im dey pool for investment.

Ponishment dey always count on di ability to increase school fees with investment.

But buyers are basically betting on startup investment fund wey no get track, and some have been encouraged to borrow to do.

One problem be sey di Internal Revenue Service don decide sey di investment, and gain from di sponsor fund, na tax.

College, and educational institution, de bin expect sey no be so e go be.

From di money wey dey return now, Oga Anderson don record record of 100% stock portfolio index wey dey market, for dey do school fees, and taxes for di 20th century.

But sponsor no fit pick di stocks wey go match market.

And de are leaning more on a fixed income, deir return after tax don add school fees, I no sure sey de go do am again o, says Oga Anderson.

Wetin happen if school fees no dey?

Florida and Wyoming don take full credit on top state government govnor, wey be sey taxpayers go carry any load.

No be so Michigan.

Dem don set up one independent agency.

Di state dey talk sey no worry, investment, plus fee, and gain from unused plan, na im go provide all di money wey e need.

Oga Putka dey teach from Wall Street Journal, Boston bureau.

If you start to dey save for your pikin ehn January 1, 1990, see di monthly sum wey you go need to invest to pay for four years for Yale, Notre Dame, and University of Minnesota.

Figures assume 7% increase for school fees, fees, room, board and 8% annual investment.

Note: dis figures na only for mandatory charges, plus book, transportation, etc.
