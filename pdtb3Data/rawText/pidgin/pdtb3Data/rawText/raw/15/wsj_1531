One labour committee dey prepare for one new buy out bid for United Airlines parent UAL Corp wey go dey carry majority of people go employees, while while some stock dey for public hand according to people wey know di group.

Di group don dey discuss one proposal wey de say from around $225 to $240, or $5.09 billion to $5.42 billion.

But to avoid di risk of rejection, di group no dey plan to submit di plan for UAL board meeting today.

Instead, di group dey raise di proposal forformally to try to see wetin di board dey do.

People wey know di company sey di board no go fit increase any price considerably under di $300 a-share, $6.79 billion hey o wey collapse last week after e no raise enough money, afta one key partner, British Airways PLC drop di deal.

For composite trading on Friday for New York Stock Exchange, UAL lock at $168.50 per share, down $21.625.

But di pilot union wey dey push for takeover since 1987, dey push for forward wit di revised bid to reduce power loss even though sey dem never find any partner to replace British Airways.

Even though di new group never get time to develop im latest idea fully, or to discuss am with bank, im believe sey person fit get bank account.

After di collapse of di last effort, di group no go plan to do any formal proposal without payment from bank wey dey cover di whole money.

Under di type of transaction wey dem dey talk about, di pilot group go borrow money wey be sey de go carry carry cash go give current bank.

Dose wey dey sell now, de go dey receive minority for di new company.

For example, di group fit get 200 pound of cash plus stock wey be 30 pound.

UALUAL get 22.6 million share, fully diluted.

Di new structure go be like recapitalisation wey person wey get special dividend suppose get, but e go still get controlling interest.

Di difference be sey person wey dey sell now, e no go get big, big business again.

Di failed one for go don give UAL employees 75% of wetin dem dey vote for di second largest country airline, with management wey dey control 10%, and British Air 15%.

E never clear how di ownership go take grow under di new plan, but people go keep more dan 50%.

Management go reduce total, and public fit get more than di 15% wey be sey British Airways don mark am.

One option wey di board dey likely consider today na some kind cooling period.

Although di pilots dey expected to continue to pursue di bid, UAL Chairman, Stephen Wolf may be told to withdraw from di buy out effort, at least, at least, and return to di company full time.

Di board fit later enter comma dey push dem to sell di company because dia member na majority shareholder vote, especially if na one out of evry UAL stock wey be sey na go-go dey hold hold o, sey na go-go dey favour di sale.

Labour leaders dey plan to give dia offer for di tabol, so dat dem go fit maintain di money wey dem dey sell give di board.

But one person wey be sey na im comot to lead dis one wey be sey na shareholder vote, Los Angeles investor, Marvin Davis, wey cause di buy out with $5.4 billion bid for early August, na im come hang back o, apparently to avoid to dey blame di deal on top di collapse.

Three top people to Oga Davis bin visit New York last week, at least in part to do meeting with executives for Citicorp.

Mr. Davis don pay $6 million for Citicorp back of im last bid.

But Citicorp don lose some credibility o because e join unsuccessful attempt to gain bank loan for labour people.

On Friday, British Air bin yarn sey dem no go do any new deal for di acquisition of UAL for future o, but some people yarn sey British Air fit still join di bidding group, and sey di carrier don carry di statement go give British regulators on top how dem wan take do securities matter wey dem don already put for di UAL buyout.

Also last week, UAL flight attendants come gree to follow di pilots do di revised offer.

But di machin union wey dey oppose di first buy out bid, dey favour if dem recapitalise am with a friendly third party investor.

One advantage wey di buy out group get na sey pilots don gree to make $200 million inside annual cost concession to finance one bid.

Spear also come out also say di UAL executive most closely identified wit di failure to gain bank loan, Chief Financial Officer John Pope, may be under pressure to resign.

But people wey be sey de know sey dis one wey be sey de wan do, sey dis one wey be sey de wan do, sey dis one wey be sey de wan do, sey dis one wey be sey de don do, sey dis one wey be sey de don do, sey dis one wey be sey de don do, sey dis one wey be sey de don do, sey dis one wey be sey de don do.

Despite di buy out group failure to get financing, UAL, dem go pay $26.7 million for investment banking, and legal fees to di group advisers, Lazard Freres & Co, Salomon Brothers Inc, and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison.
