Abeg, follow your offer na wetin Felipe Bince Jr.

Dem dey report di prospective investors wey gather inside di board room for di Philippine Government Investment Investment Trust sey di money wey be sey de dey sell na 36% interest for di country largest paper mill.

Di agency dey expect di bid to be equivalent of more than $ 80 million.

No one among una wey dem sakrifice give God.

Oga Bince, di trust associate executive trustee, e don yarn sey di bidding na failure, e don dey sell, e mutter as e dey comot for di room.

True, true.

E never too tey wey dem sell one paper mill, one bank, one office building and one small cotton cotton cotton plant.

Of di four, na only di bank, and di plant dew bid, one piece.

For October 1987, Presido Corazon Aquino bin promise sey im government go sell all, or some part of di state hold for many companies wey be sey government don dey control for di 20 years wey be sey Ferdinand Marcos don dey rule.

After two years, Mrs. Aquino don promise well, well.

October na critical month for di privatisation.

Manila dey offer many, many major asset now, and e dey try to conclude sales wey de don arrange.

In addition, government don dey scheduled to unveil plans for privatisation of Philippine Airlines, di national carrier, an effort wey lawyer, and business columnist, Rodolfo Romero, dey call di bell of privatisation, all of dem na tins wey dey di line up to $1.03 billion.

Sey di privatisation, na to just clear di government of hundreds of asset, and to raise vital funds.

Many of di money wey dem dey sell, dem dey mark am for multibillion dollar agragragra.

But di way we dey do o, na indifference, bureaucratic resistance, legal system wey dey operate at snail pace, political opposition, and government misjudement don dey against us.

Most recently now, de don add one person wey no get buyer join di list.

Instead of dem to gather momentum, di programme dey for danger of slowing even more as government dey tackle some big asset.

Di axiom appear to be sey di more valuable di asset, di harder di privatisation process, you no just see big ting wey dey happen, one international economist.

To be sure sey di programme, e no get how e be.

Di Asset Private Trust, di agency oga wey dey sell government property don record over $500 million since dem start to dey operate for December 1986.

But dem dey sell small, small kon sell dia propaty wey dem value well-well.

To dey queue for market dis month fit be very hard o because almost every wahala wey don happen for past dey come up again.

Naomi Gardin, di Asset Trust executive trustee, de admit wetin e call timetable setback, on top of di poor result now, e say di agency dey adopt rate of flexibility.

October wahala start wen dem no sell one state owned commercial bank, Associated Bank, for di low price of 671 million pesin (31 million)...

At di end of di month, di agency go again dey offer bank.

Instead of di money wey dem dey sell, na di money wey dem dey sell na di money wey dem dey sell give di pipol.

But bankers talk sey e go hard government to sell di institution even if no rupee.

Bank get negative net worth dey yarn.

Dem add special rule give di bank former oga, Leonardo Ty, di right to bid on top di highest bid.

Mr. Ty lost power for government for 1980 when one government bank do emergency loan to di cash-strapped institution.

For 1983, dem convert di loan to equity give Manila 98% of di bank, but wit di understanding wey be sey Oga Ty don repurchase right.

E get power to match any bid, e don scare many potential buyers.

Separation, government go try again once in a month to sell di 36% stake for paper industrial corp, or pipo as per di paper mill.

Di price go depend on how much Picop take dey fetch local stock market.

But according by banker, and stock analyst wey don do di paper mill, no be di only consideration.

As e take stand now, government go continue to hold 45% of Picop after di 36% stake wey dem sell, around 7.5% of Picop, and oder shareholders dem get di rest of di equity. Potential buyers, most of di foreign company, dem no dey gree take agriment on top di company matter wey be sey government go carry on top di matter to recover recover.

CAN wey be sey de wan buy new bank account wey no dey manage manage, at least three foreign buyers, even one member of di Elders group for Australia, talk sey dem go drop di money wey dem dey sell so.

Mr. Garcia acknowledge di problem, and e say Asset Trust go study why di bidding fail, and wetin di agency go fit change.

But under government regulation, foreign ownership of Picop equity, na limited to 40%.

Even dough government go retain di 45% stake for Picop, critics don come out talk sey di trust wey dem dey sell to foreigner, na im de dey claim.

One series of newspaper wey talk sey dem accuse government sey dem no do short change on top di Picop sale.

Oga Garcia tok sey dem don announce on top of di Picop bidding, and possible legislation wey dey on top paper mill sales matter, na im dem criticise for di agency o.

Di matter fit even make dem stop to dey do oga patapata for government wey be sey na dem get 99% of wetin dey inside.

Di one wey dey go, na trans Pacific and Asian road e dey pass, but e still dey slow, and e no get how e dey manage.
