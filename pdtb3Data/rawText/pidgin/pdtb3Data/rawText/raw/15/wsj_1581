Senate reject one constitutional amendment wey Presido bush bring to protect U.S flag from desecration.

Di 51-48 wey dem dey call come short well, well of di two third majority wey dey support change for di Constitution.

Di vote, wey 11 Republican lawmakers bin vote against Mr. Bush, na victory for dem wey bin oppose di amendment as intrusion on top di Bill of Rights, we fit support American flag without changing American Constitution, said Senate Majority Leader, George Mitchell of Maine.

To defuse pressure on an amendment, Mr. Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas Foley (di, Wash) don organise bill to pass a statute barring flag desecretion before dem go vote on top constitutional amendment.

Oga Bush bin yarn sey e go allow di bill to become law without im signature because e talk sey na only when im give constitutional amendment im go fit protect di flag well, well.

For June, Supreme Court troway conviction of one Texas man wey set flag afta one 1984 demonstration say im dey put hand for political expression wey dey protect di First Amendment.
