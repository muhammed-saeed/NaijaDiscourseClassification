Di list of laboratories wey dey claim to dey produce inexplicable heat from cold fusion, dey slowly dey increase.

But no firm evidence show say extra heat dey come from di fusing of hydrogen atoms.

New science wey dey inside big national lab, still dey show hints of nuclear fusion, e comot only di point of tritium for one Texas experiment to support di University of Utah chemists claim sey dem go do hydrogen fusion for temperature room.

Di latest one wey dey for cold fusion research, dem do am inside 24 report wey di fall for here of di Electrochemical Society, di first scientific meeting inside five months to hear formal report on top cold fusion research.

Di meeting show strong evidence for one serious scientific exercise wey dem dey do for cold fusion research.

For di 1,300 chemist wey go society society meeting, no pass 200 sit down for day time, and half of kold fusion wey go happen for week end.

Dis one dey different from di one wey di society do for di matter last May, wen more than 1,500 scientists, plus many many reporters and TV crew, enter one hotel wey dey Los Angeles hotelroom for one special night session on top di matter.

Two chemist wey provoke provoke for kold kpatakpata, Martin Fleischmann and B. Stanley Pons, no dey dere.

But some members of one adhoc expert committee wey dem set up by Department of Energy to go round up di cold fusion research, na dem dey give di talk.

Di committee na to recommend for di end of di month wheder you go support cold fusion research.

Most of di two dozen scientists wey dey podium, de report result wit new, more sophisticated variations of di smallest electrolysis of water experiments wey dey described last month by Messrs.

Fleichmann and Pons.

Di experiments na to round one thin metal wey dem dey call palladium metal, with one platinum wire, come put di two electrode inside one heavy water wey dem dey call deuteronomy.

When dem put light for di palapaladium, and platinum electrode, di heavy water come begin dey quench, or dissociate.

Ordinarily di electrolysis, or breakup, di water go take almost all di power.

But Messrs.

Fleichmann and Pons say dia experiment too get heat.

Dem talk sey di fuel, plus di power wey di water molecules go take melt, dem add more power inside di apparatus dan to give fire.

Because de go don detect tritium, and indication of nuclear radiation, dem go talk sey di "excess" heat energy go come out from the power wey di nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms dey inside di palladium rod.

For inside last weekend, na twelf lab also don report on top sey heat from different, different kind of heat from different, different kind of heat from different, different kind of heat.

One of di seven report wey de present here of excess heat, na by Richard A. Oriani, professor of chemical engineering for University of Minnesota.

Oga Oriani talk sey di first time wen e do im first experiment wen e dey grow no dey produce result.

But e con borrow palladium rod from chemists for Texas A&M wey talk sey de dey hot well, well, e con say di result dey interesting o.

On di fourth “run ” with di borrowed rod, di experiment begin produce excess heat.

Di experiment stop small, small to change one instrument.

When dem restart am, heat come give am well, well, come give am plenty heat for many hours before di heat die.

Normal of oder experiments, Orioni say deir experiment na "very stupid", e go continue to dey do nothing, e go dissociate di heavy water, den at very unpredictable times, e go begin produce excess heat for as long as 10, or 11 hours before e go quiet down.

Di excess heat na 15% to 20 percent pass for electrolysis of water.

Oga Oriani talk sey di heat too much and e go too long before di sudden release of energy wey fit don happen small, small for di experiments wey dem dey do, as some scientists talk sey e get reality to di excess energy.

Oda scientists say dem too dey get sporadic heat wey dey last several hours for one time.

Di burst often dey occur, de say after dey do hard work, de go raise, or de go reduce light, or de go switch di current current, and on.

One chemist wey dey inside, na im dey yarn dis one sey some ‘anomalousous' chemical reactions fit dey give di heat.

One reason wey dey worry di heat matter be sey, dem dey measure well, well.

Energy wey dey come out from one kwota of kwota of kwota of kwota of kwota of kwota of kwota of kwota of kwota of kwota of kwota of kwota.

One exception na ongoing experiment for Stanford University wey dem dey put 10 watts of energy inside di electrical engineering cells.

One cell wey get heavy water dey produce 1.0 to 1.5 watts of heat pass one full of ordinary water next to am, according to Turgut M. Gur wey be professor of materials, Robert A. Huggins, wey be head of Stanford experimental group.

One of di ting wey dey show sey di excess heat, na from di short one wey chemist John Bockris of Texas A&M University give am.

Oga Bockris don first talk sey too much heat, e dey see as tritium dey melt inside heavy water.

E say before some time now, im don get evidence sey di way wey be sey di heat dey increase, na im be sey de dey produce tritium.

No how we go dey measure tritium for heavy water so we go dey wonder wheder di tritium dey relate to heat, or some oder phenomenon.

Dey use more time dey measure neutrons (di one wey go show sey fusion dey go), de go dey negative.

Messrs.

Fleichmann and Pons first report indirect neutron wey dey show for di experiment but later, dem con still concede say di amount na questionable.

Research people for Sandia National Laboratory for Albuque, N.M., go far reach for one cold fusion experiment and three neutron detector inside one tunnel under 300 feet of granite to take protect di detectors from cosmic rays.

Number of times wey de go detect neutron inside one, sometimes two of di three detector, but only once during di 411 hours wey dem do di experiment, dem go see neutron inside all three detector, and dem go say na spurious event.

Shimson Diefeld of Los Alamos National Laboratory say researchers dem see burst of neutron from one early cold fusion experiment last April, but dem no gree announce am until dem fit confirm am.

In subsequent experiments, one of two neutron detector dey sometimes indicate burst, neutron wey dey both detector.

Dem conclude di indication of neutrons stemming from mistake for detector, instead of di cold fusion experiment.

For Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory inside California, new experiment wey dem do, show sey di lithium add to di heavy water so dat e go fit give electrical wey don already dey on top di palladium rod wey be sey na Messia.

Fleichmann and Pons fit don misinterpret am, Philip Ross wey come from California lab dey report am.
