Guillermo Ortiz's Sept. 15 America's column, Masico'S Been Bitter by di privatisation bug, na refreshing statement of im government sey e don dey committed to privatisation, and dem must welcome am as e be for all Americans wey wan wish im country well.

Mexico United State Institute, dey happy to see so ogbonge govnor like Mexico sey e don dey under di sece of finance finance for im country now. For di context of di big, big change wey dey happen for free market economics, especially for inside statist countries.

As we don talk am finish, e good make we warn una about wetin fit happen if una go on top mistake.

E no too true sey for inside Mexico government, dem don "privatize" Mexican de Aviacion as Oga Ortiz take dey claim.

Na di same sentence e take contradict imsef wen e talk sey government still retain 40% on top di total amount of di airline.

How dem go take talk about one company wey dem dey call privatisation if di state too much for di state? (True-true, di Medes government don give dem authority to direct di airline to one private company, but im propensity to carry back wetin e dey give too much for person to be bloody.)

Wonder sef, Oga, Oga, Ortiz dey do di same numbering exercise wen e dey boast sey no be only 392 state enterprises currently dey for public sector, down from di 1,155 public entity wey dey for 1982, but di enterprises still dey inside state, plus di biggest and most powerful ones for Mexico, even though dem sama all di economic infrastructure.

I mean petroleum, electric, banking, newsprint.

Dose enterprises, de no go privatise dem.

Dem don officially declare dem “straegic” and dem sey dem go do di privatisation if na Mexico Constitution o.

For dat side of di issue, Mr. Ortiz write sey di divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprise na one essential part of President Carlos Salinas plan to modernize Mexico economy na e clear sey modernisation must embrace di key industry before dem go talk sey e don catch di privaccation bug.

Di bottom line now, no be economic ting, na political reform.

A long succession of Mexican presidents dey drag nationality for any industry wey dem like to, without giving any answer to public.

To guarantee sey Mezaya dey Aviacion, and oder company go really privatise, Mezaya need pluri-party political system wey go make sure sey democracy dey, and if na after dat one na im dem go take do am.
