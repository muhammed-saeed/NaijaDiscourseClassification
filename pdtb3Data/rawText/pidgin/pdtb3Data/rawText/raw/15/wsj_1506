U.S. dey required to notify foreign government if e know sey coup plan fit end deir life, government spokesman tok.

Di notification policy na part of one set of guidelines on handling coup wey dem outline for one secret 1988 exchange of letters between Reagan administration, Senate Intelligence Committee.

Di existence of di guidelines don begin since President Bush open mouth give seven republic senators inside one white house last Monday.

Oga Presido for di meeting, e con give di policy one example of how di administration go take do am wey dey cause all dis kind wahala wey be sey dis month futile attempt wey dem dey do for Panamanian dictator, Manuel Noriega.

According to di officials, Oga Bush even read to di senators select from one very classified letter from di committee to di White House dey discuss di guidelines.

Dem say di Presido concede say di notification request no affect im decision to lend only small support to dis month Panama coup attempt.

No notification was given, officials said maybe because U.S. don't think say coup plotters wan kill Mr. Noriega, but na just to arrest am.

Wetin further, na di administration, and congressional officials na im dey yarn sey dem go drop di notification request from di guidelines on top coup attempt wey be sey di panel, and di white house dey write.

Di rewriting, dem launch am for one meeting wey be sey na between Oga Bush and intelligence committee leaders, Oct. 12 days before di meeting wey be sey di president don come outside dey para on top di matter.

But di way dem take present di guidelines, na im dem first report for inside NBC news last night, dem don dey interpret am for Capitol Hill as anoda yeye attempt to force Congress people.

E don reopen di bitter vexnashon wey dey between Oyibo and Oyibo on top sey na dem cause di failure of Oyibo, Noriega and, well, well on top sey dem dey do big, big work for oda country.

A statement wey di office of di committee chairman, Sen. David Boren (division), na im dey yarn o sey di investigation na part of ongoing effort wey dem dey carry on top di failure of di new coup attempt wey dem dey do for Panama.

Di statement still add, “Somebody don regret to select section of very classified correspondence between di two branches of government.

No be only sey dis one dey near law, e dey violate di trust wey we don do to develop.

Sen. Boren con talk sey time don reach make di country stop to dey condemn, and work togeder to develop one clear, and appropriate policy wey go help di country in future.

I don call Presido say make e send im suggestion to di committee.

Informate Publican Sen. William Cohen of Maine, di panel vice chairman, na im yarn of di yarn sey di text torn out of context na pretext, and e dey unfair for Oyinbo people wey dey leak evidence for inside selective fashion.

Sey di committee no go fit defend demsef by presenting di documents public because dat one go against classification.

But di chairman, and oder committee members, dey yarn sey di notification go not put on top di White House by a meddling congress.

Instead, two of dem wey dey inside Congress, and administration people, na dem come dey grow outside dey talk about coup plot for Panama wey be sey na administration start am for July 1988, wey be sey na last October.

Di guideline no be law, but na joint interpretation of how U.S. go take operate during foreign coup for light of di long standing presidential order wey dey banning U.S. assassination matter.

In fact, yesterday wey be sey administration, and congress still dey different on top wetin de agree.

One administration oga say notification even if U.S. "get wind" of somebody else coup plan wey be sey e go likely end dictator life.

But one person wey dey inside Congress wey dey close to di panel, talk sey di rule na only covered coup plan wey involve U.S.

Although di notification go not do for dis month coup attempt, some administration people dey argue sey e fit cause fear, and uncertainty on top di part of U.S. intelligence, and military operatives for Panama.

One senior administration oga call di guideline “Outrageous", and e say e fit make U.S operatives no even listen to coup plan because dem fit enter court.

Di matter con reach one head last year, officials con recall o partly because di Reagan administration, dem pursue am unsuccessfully to win committee approval for new Panama coup attempt.

In addition, both administration, and congressional officials say di need for guidelines on coup and assassination, na partly because Oyinbo deceive dem to avoid bad oda obodo Oyinbo during election campaign.

Though di Assassination ban na White House order wey never vote on top, intelligence committee fit dey influence di interpretation.

Last week, Central Intelence Agency Director, William Webster, na im come outside dey call on top Congress to provide new interpretation of di Assassination order wey go allow U.S. to allow more freedom to act in coup.

Administration don resignment say e mislead di latest coup attempt by attempting to blame Congress for restriction wey Oyibo talk sey e don misuse im freedom of action.

But, last week wey be sey Oga Webster two top CIA wey be sey de bin don sama di spy agency alias spy agency for Panama.

But administration boo, administration boo, e be like sey de don make some headquarter wit Sens.

Borne and Cohen afta dem do dia Oct. 12 meeting with Presido.

Di three men gree to rewrite di law without changing di basic assassination ban to clear any confusion wey fit don cause U.S. to provoke for coup against American leaders.

Di new argument on top di notification channel fit sharge any atmosphere of cooperation.

Gerald F. Seib dey among the people wey we write this topic.
