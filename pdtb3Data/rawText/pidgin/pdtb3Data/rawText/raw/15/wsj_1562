CAN YOU MAKE up your mind about investment, di rest is easy?

You just call your broker say buy, or sell.

Dream am On!

There are different ways to give, and sell instructions to a broker, and just as many ways to burn, you no know wetin you dey do.

So dis one wey be sey de dey run down from most normal, normal market order wey be sey de dey sell stock, and commodity exchange.

“E get two tins wey una go remember: Nor bi evritin wey anoda pesin take dey buy and sell, na di same dem bi.

And even when specific order dey acceptable for di exchange, brodas and sistas no go fit enter am for customer.

Market Order: Dis one fit be di most common order and dis one dey free pipol wey dey buy with wayo, since dem no dey pay any price.

For market order, one investor talk sey make e buy, or sell for market like sey get me now, or get me now, sey if de dey sell wheat for $4.065, and dey sell am for $4.060, na di higher price go dey buy, and na di lower price go dey buy.

One new thing wey dem yarn na sey some floor mate for di two big, big city for Chicago, dey sell market, dey call customer price wey dey low, dey arrange business wit fellow traders.

Profets go come see sey from dis business, na fake traders go dey do am.

Limit order: Limit how investors wan take reduce money, or pay for investment.

Investors dey do am to know di money wey dem fit take buy di investment, or di money wey dem fit take buy am.

Think am sey person wey dey buy something want sell stock, but e no sell am less dan five thousand.

Limiting price fit enter dat price.

One risk be sey person wey get business, dem go regret am if di stock reach 54, den e fall.

If di market go at least one tick (di lowest price) wey dey market, investors no go fit get deir order because dem no fit get enough trading volume wey go allow dem dey buy at di normal price.

Stop Order: Stop Order Order, tell floor broker make e buy, sell investment once di money reach where e suppose be.

Once di price reach dat level, na so e go be, till market go enter market, and di price wey di broker fit get, na im de go add.

Stoploss sometimes dey call am stoploss because dem dey always use am dey protect profit, or limit loss.

To stop or stop, na di same tin with to stop, but e get anoda difference: To sell stop, na to buy stop for di current market, den to buy stop for above.

But na where dey for market dem go sell limit, na dere de go sell limit.

Di crash for October 1987, and last Friday wen e happen, e teach some investors exactly wetin go happen, and dem no go do again.

One investor wey may be sey e don buy stoploss order of $90 under one stock wey dey sell at $100 a share on Friday before di crash na to discover sey di stock don fill at $75 when di stock open for Monday.

Di kommand wey dey di market na to stop oda kobo na to stop oda kobo na to stop oda kobo wey dey sell only for di normal price.

If e no fit buy am dat price, e no go fill.

Investors wey wan get more dan di normal prize for market fit use di money wey dey di order take know di prize.

But if di market move go front, e go hard for di broker to carry out di order because di investment don add money.

Market if-touche Order: Market if-touche order bi like stop to buy, if di price wey dey market don rish.

But unlike oda kountry-men, na di same price dem dey sell market-... if na di same price dem dey sell market.

Na di price wey de sell for market, di broker wey dey sell for floor go fill am di best possible price.

“Fill-Or-Kill Order: Di fill-up or kill order na one of di tins wey dey koncern doz wey dey sell.

E dey tell broker sey make e buy am, or sell am at di fixed price, or na di correct price.

But if person no fit buy di investment, or e go sell am immediately, di order go fit cancel.

Grigory Bessemer wey enter second for di stock division for di U.S. trading competition talk sey e dey use fillo, or kill order almost exclusively when e dey sell market, e dey talk sey I dey like to use am dey sell market, e dey talk sey if de no dey fill am immediately, I go fit enter new price, or try again with di same price.

No-Helder Order: Dis na anoda time.

E get market order wey allow floor scribes to take more time to buy, or sell investment if dem tink sey dem fit get di better price by waiting.

No hold order wey dem dey call dis retract tape order, dey always do for customer risk.

One-Cancels-Oda order: Dis na two kommandments wey dey inside one unit, wey be sey, dem dey use di same security or commodity take dey instruct floor mate sey make dem first order, den cancel di oda order.

For fast moving market, e dey stop investor make e no get two leg wey dem take dey do business for di same security.

Special-Time Order: Dis type of order, na im dey follow many of di kommand wey dey inside sey make dem do am for, or by some time, for different, different types of order.

For example, for market on top of di day, na di normal time wey dem dey sell for di day, na di normal time wey dem dey sell for di day, na di normal time wey dem dey sell for market, na im dey stop all orders wey only dey do for di closing minutes of trading, na im dey expire for di day wey dem enter for di day wey dem enter for good time.

Most brethren dey assume sey all order na day order except for specified clause.

On Oct. 19, 1987, some investors come learn wetin go happen if dem enter Good Til-Abana law, come forget am.

Dem find out sey de don buy stock wey de say de go don enter weeks, or months before de forget to cancel.

“ ‘Make yu always dey do wetin di pipol wey dey invest go do.

Investors wey change deir mind about buying, or selling after order don do, usually dey carry wetin go come out.
