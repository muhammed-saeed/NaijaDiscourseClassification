FOX HUNTING EFCC don define am as person wey no dey talk to inedible, but at least na to dey do exercise.

At least e get small gift.

Many of us must do work wey no cost, no be wetin we dey do, but na wetin we dey do.

Like to buy insurance for life, for example, one thing wey we dey do, especially in dash.

12Make una koll am, ‘Unified Person’ and una go koll am, “Unified Person.”

But sooner, or later, most of us gats dey tink of life insurance just as we dey tink of having rut, canal work.

And my time don come.

I dey 33, I marry, no pikin, and I dey 33, dey write story like dis.

Sometimes, insurance company dey target head of household, ehn but our own na two income family we don already dey do.

So if anytin happen to me, I go gats leave am enough wey be sey my 33 years old husband go fit pay di mortgage, and some oder money (thought be sey I dey borrow am, na sey I go carry di potential second wife enter luxury).

Di Figo wey be sey maybe $100,000 to one million, but no know di policy wey I wan do, I look di number of company wey I get, twelve company wey I go enter inside Gibberish.

Over di past decade, or two, as I dey tink about fox hunting, insurance company don bring out many, many products, variations on top of product, and variations on top of product.

Apart from term life, and life (di old standby now), we get universal life, universal variable life, flexible universal life, policy wit persisting bonus, policy festering with exotic riders, and on, and on.

Wetin again?

Number one, generalize.

For all di riders, special provision, and oder bell, and whistle, insurance policy fit still dey under two broad category: so-... pure insurance wey dey pay only on death, and permanent insurance wey be sey no be only death benefit, but also money wey be sey de dey use inside policy wey be sey de still dey alive.

If all you want na death benefit coverage, pure insurance, term policy na im dey give you maximum banga for your buck within limits.

E cheap pass permanent insurance wey you buy at di same age.

But term just dat, di policy dey for one particular time only, and you go renew am when e don expire.

It may also stipulate sey di insured must pass anoda medical exam before renewal, if you flunk (wey be sey you need insurance pass any oder time), you no go fit buy am.

Even if you dey healthy, and you fit renew, your premium go go up, because you be dat old man.

So term insurance fit no be as e fine reach.

Different types of confusion on top of term insurance insurance, policy wey dey pay you mortgage, term riders con sack you for permanent insurance, and many oders.

One variation wey con appeal to me first na di moneyy Smart Term Life policy wey Amex Life Insurance Co, di American Express unit to di parent credit card holders.

But upon examination, I bin look wheder di plan make sense.

Amex talk sey e go give me five76 a year for coverage, and e go pay me back all di premium wey I dey pay if I cancel di policy after 10 years.

Sound big abi e dey?

First, if I cancel, I no go get insurance again, big money.

Second, di $5,760 wey I go get back, e go reduce well, well by 10 years of inflation, Amex no go be me, e go get di gain of my money, income wey go don pass di pump price, and di tax wey di company go pay big, big money.

Third, and most important, Amex go charge me higher, higher premium dan oder reputable company dem for di same amount, I go dey pay so much just to get my premium back wey be sey I go almost cancel to get am back wey be sey di whole thing dey worthwhile.

Dat one go be all right wit Amex wey go con lock di investment money, but e no add on top di smart money move for me.

Wey go show sey di First Law dey for insurance, as in every oda, free lunch no dey, na only marketing.

And di second law, unique to insurance?

If I die early, I win, hollow win, because I no fit enjoy am, and if I live long, insurance go win.

Byways.

E good make you remember wen insurers, and deir sales people try to sell you permanent insurance di one wey be sey de dey collect money.

Di word death, dem no fit eazy for di industry, but sales people dey dodge am for anywhere wey possible, or wrap am for euphemism, prefer to talk about saving, and investment.

Di implication be sey your permanent insurance policy na really some kind of CD, or mutual fund account wit extra feature.

Dat one dey gi-am lily.

In fact, as savings, or investment motor, insurance generally dey run poor second to any direct investment wey you fit make for di same ting wey insurance company dey put your money into.

Dat is because you have to pay for di policy, and effort to sell, and service di whole package.

Again, no free lunch.

Dis one wey dem build in death, in effect, your share of di company estimated liability wey dey pay di people wey get di effortion, die under di protection of di company.

And most cases, big chunk of your premium in di initial year, or two of di policy, na im dey pay di sales commission, and investment contribution on most policies, na im dey negatively credited for many policies o.

So view permanent insurance for wetin e be, compromise between pure insurance, and direct investment.

Di simplest, most traditional form of permanent insurance na di straight full life policy.

You dey pay set amount of coverage, di company invest dat premium for portfolio of its choice, and your cash, and dividend dey grow inside di years.

One new wrinkle, wey dem dey call single premium life (you dey pay for di whole policy at once), dey popular for recent years because of tax matter, wey be sey insurance dey collect money, and none of di money na tax based policy o, even though sey na gain on investment.

Congress close dis loophole last year, or tink am sef.

But Monarch Capital Corp, of Springfield, Mass, don develop one kind (combination plan) of annuity, and insurance policy wey be sey e no dey against new regulation, and wey be sey policy no dey against tax.

But your cash reserve wey you go fit take, na small.

I no dey prepare for any case to put dat much money for policy kwa, so I look for broad category wey dem dey call universal life.

Human being dey very, very flexible, very life.

I fit adjust di money wey I wan take buy insurance, I fit pay more, or less dan di so called target price for a given year, and I fit even skip payment if my cash don do wetin dey inside di policy.

Looking at dis, and oder policy, I learn to ask pointed questions about some of di assumptions wey dey inside "policy illustrations", di rows wey dey show me di build up of my cash value over di years.

Dem dey generally give two scenario namely di one wey be sey di company dey guarantee (typically na 4% to 4.5), and di oder one wey be sey de dey increase investment, na usually eight percent or more.

For di end of many years, I dey see my cash build up, e dey very big, but di high interest rate dey possible for dat long period?

No be likely I think.

Also some policy example wey dey talk sey mortality go decrease, or sey I go get some kind dividend after 10th year.

Dis one no be true o.

Compani no dey fit play dis game, but de know sey de dey under pressure to make deir policy good," Timothy Pfier wey be actuarized consultant for Tillinghast, one unit of Towers Perrin Co, di big New York consulting firm.

Anoder factor to consider be sey some of di companies wey dey make big money now, na through huge investment of junk bond, and you know how nervous market be for people wey dey sell now.

The things wey dey happen for heaven and earth dey sopraiz us and e fit make us ask question about all of dem.

For back yard, for example, one friend dey boast sey na only money she go pay on top John Hancock policy for seven years, and dat her death benefit go con be guaranteed, I go call her agent David Dominici.

Yes e dey talk sey, price on top dis variable rate wey dem dey sell after some period, but usually, na only if deir rate still dey high wey be sey de dey buy insurance wey be sey de dey buy every month.

If intrest rate, insurance dey knock for my door, dey ask for steeper premium, to maintain di same amount of protection.

I no like dat sound.

Some insurers too don begin dey offer extra dividend, or marginal interest rate wey be sey de don maintain di policy for 10 years.

But Glenn Daily, one New York based financial consultant, e dey yarn sey many of dis bonuses na just fantasies because most of dem no be guaranteed by di companies.

And di feature dey new e add sey no insurer don establish track wey go dey pay real money.

So-... called life-benefits provision also merit a close inspection.

Among di insurers wey be sey na security connecticut life insurance Co, Jackson National Life Insurance Co, and National Travelers Life Insurance Co, dis policy riders let me carry some of my death benefit waka while I still dey alive.

Some provision go allow me collect percentage of di policy policy tay, tay, tay, tay, tay, tay, tay, tay, tay, tay, tay, tay, tay, tay, tay.

But di kain katakata wey policy holders dey carry, na small, small kata, from policy to policy, and generally, permit to use only small of di face of insurance.

Also, financial planners dey advise on insurance say to deir knowledge, de never get tax wey dey favour dis advance payment.

And considering di extra money wey dey inside, some people wey dey interested sey, to pay for extended nursing home, e go better dan to just buy separate policy wey dey provide.

Di one wey better pass be sey no load life, even dough sey na low load life.

Insurance dey sell dis policy policy directly to public, or oders, e still get load, annual admin fee, and initial set up, but I dey find out sey di lack of commission, and compulsory fee wey de dey drop di policy early, early, e still dey save me well, well.

I compare one universal policy of $130,000 to di one wey be sey na from dat one insurer, American Life Insurance Corp, of Lincoln, Neb. With di same offer wey Equitable Life Assurance Society of U.S. dey operate through 11,000 commissioned sales people.

After one year, I fit waka comot for Ameritas policy wit $792, but I go only collect $14 from Equitable.

Di difference dey grow small, small, small.

At di age of 65, when I go stop to dey pay premium, Ameritas go bring di money wey be sey de go pay am $14,000 higher dan di one wey be sey, even though sey di policy wey dey for Equitable talk sey de go dey higher dan di one wey dey dere.

I buy am?

Ehn no be now.

I dey tink of using di $871 annual premium to finance a trip to Paris first.

Person fit do some kind heavy thinking for insurance dere, and shop for someting wey dey exciting while e dey do am.
