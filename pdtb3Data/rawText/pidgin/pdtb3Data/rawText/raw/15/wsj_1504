Oga Stone don stew for one letter wey im manager carry give am say e dey under parole for insubordination.

Oga Stone say di discipline dey unfair, e believe sey di manager wan pursue am because of im own matter.

Unable to persuade di manager to change im decision, e go join company court for hearing.

At di time wey e suppose do, Oga Stone con enter one room for one building wey near im work.

After di three members wey di court carry come, na im di chairman for di panel come talk sey, “Make una go ahead, tell us wetin happen.

We fit even ask you question as you dey go, or we fit wait till di end.

No lawyer, no tape recorder dey dere.

Di only oda people na couple of personnel specialist, one of dem wey know Oga Stone case well, well, and e go help fill any facts wey dem need to present for di court.

On top coffee cup, Oga Stone tell im story.

E talk about 20 minute.

When e dey through, court people come dey torchlight many question o, den chairman come talk sey de go like hear im manager side dey talk to witness.

Di chairman promise Oga Stone sey within two weeks, e go do one o.

Ob Stone na fictional name o, but di incident wey happen be sey na real one.

E happen for Northrop Corp.

Di court dey call di Management Appeals Committee, or just MAC, and e be like sey na couple of case every year.

After some details of dis example, and e fit dey happen today for Federal Express, for Memphis, di Defence and Underseas System of Honeywell for Minneapolis, General Electric plant for Columbia, Md, or any oda company.

Di companies na pioneers wey be sey na one kind big trend for corporate world be sey na im dey increase wetin I dey call corporate due process.

Although corporate dey practice today for small company, maybe 40 to 60, na one of di fastest growth wey don take place for di industry.

For di coming ten years, many of dem go adopt am.

Depending on different reasons, different company dey appeal to management.

E dey reduce lawsuit from bribe, and ex-officers, plus all dis one mean sey na small bribe, and better public relation matter go reduce.

E dey help make union dey strong.

E dey increase employee commitment to di company with all dose tins wey be sey for efficiency, and quality control.

Wetin your management team go do to establish corporate due process?

Four main steps go dey here:

1

You get strong personnel department.

E must be able to handle most of di complain wey no dey settle for trench by management, and deir subordinates, oder company court, deir adjournment go dey inundated with case.

For Polaroid, di Personnel Planning Committee may hear only about 20 case in a year, and di rest of di many many complain, dey go on till date.

For TWA, di System of Adjustment dey hear 50 to 75 case every year, na only fraction of di complain wey people dey carry come, na im dey go.

For inside Citicorp, di problem review board may hear only 12 or so cases because of personnel skill for diaplainment.

In a typical year, up to 20% of di work force dey go meet personnel specialist wit complain of unfair treatment.

For one big company wey be sey many many complain for people wey dey work, dem dey handle am.

2

For instance, or privately, train all your manager, and supervisor for di company due process approach.

See sey de know company personnel policy back and forward because na di “ law ” governing company court and adjourment.

Dey carry dem go handle complain so dat de go settle quarrel sharp, sharp.

In case manager, and personnel specialist, dem misbehaving, and subordinate dey go complain for company court, or adjudicator, teach managers make de accept reversal, because in a good, due process system dey bound to happen.

For di 15 company wey I do, reversal rate dey from di average from 20% to 40%.

3

Dey think am wheder you wan panel system, or single adjudicator.

Panel system wey be like dat for Bob Stone example dey benefit like high credibility, and, for panelists, mutual support.

E get one adjudicator system (wey be sey person wey dey first look wetin dey happen, later switch switch to sey wetin dey happen, dey use speed, wey be sey na im dey do pass, and wey be sey na im dey control wetin dey happen.)

International Business Machine and Bank of America dey among di companies wey dey use single adjudicator approach.

4

Dey show your due process.

E no go do any good for anybody except sey person wey dey work for am know.

Most management no dey let dem do all dis tins wey dey happen because of fear of wetin fit make person wey dey sick, wey dey sick, and wey dey sick dey go complain.

No be only sey de dey make sure sey deir system dey for inside deir handbook, and personnel specialist dey talk to dem.

Smith Kline Beecham go further, sometimes dey feature her grieving procedure for closed circuit TV.

Natural, one of di best way to take guarantee light for your due process system na for di top management to support am.

For IBM, di Open Door system dey sometimes get memorandum wey be di main executive.

The Federal Express go further on top di matter pass any company wey I know with with Frederick Smith, James Barksdale, di chief executive, and chief operating officer respectively, na dem dey sit down for di Appeals Board almost every Tuesday to judge case.

Mr. Ewing na consultant wey dey for Winchester, Mass, and di author of Justice on di Job: Resolving Grievances in di Nonunion Workplace (Harvard Business Press, 1989).
