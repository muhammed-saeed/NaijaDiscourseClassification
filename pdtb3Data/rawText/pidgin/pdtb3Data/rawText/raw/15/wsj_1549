For East Germany, where pipol don too laugh about politics matter, de no just dey laugh about deir new leader, Egon Krenz.

Oga Krenz na sooparo pesin wey no even get any correct joke about am.

One East German mama wey like to dey do jibiti for political barbing, talk sey with Krenz, we no just know wetin we dey expect. Oga, Krenz no be di knee jerk hardlineer wen dem select am last week make e go succeed Erich Honecker.

But im no be sey im dey ready to do big, big change.

According to East Germany's ADN news agency, Oga Krenz follow up with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on top of di weekend, and e con even talk sey East Germany fit learn from Moscow glasnost policy.

By dis time last week, Oga, Krenz begin to dey update di way we dey look for news wey dey fly for East Germany.

On Thursday, one day after e take office, East German television start to dey give talk wey people dey call in question for panel of govnor to dey answer.

Di kain regular news wey dey reach night, and daily newspapers dey go on top of Soviet glasnost.

One 43 years old East German shopkeeper talk sey for di first time inside my life, I no sure wheder I dey hear di news, or West German television.

Other changes including easing restrictions on travel for East Germany, na im go take place.

But whether dat one fit affect di confidence of East Germany (wey be sey na di kain increase wey dey happen for recent weeks to show sey democratic change dey), na mostly sey dem fit trust Oga, Krenz.

And dat one na wahala.

Oga Krenz no just identify wit en mentor, Oga Honecker, but e still blame for organising a violent police action against protesters dis month and praise China for sending tanker against student protesters, and Rainer Eppelmann, one Protestant pastor for East Berlin, di biggest ting be sey e get chance.

Aldough Mr. Krenz don give East Germany communistists strong head, but im style dey different from im party comrades own.

Unlike Mr. Honecker wey dey lecture people about socialist values, Mr. Krenz dey like to dey ask question.

One of the things wey e do as leader na to go visit one machine wey dem dey call gritty machine for where dem dey call Berlin, and e dey waka with people wey dey work for der.

Later dem show am for television, dey do field question.

At one point, e con ask one worker wheder e think sey East Germany dey run comot for di country because of as e take dey do travel policy.

Di worker tart reply be sey no be only travel.

People get sense sey government dey ignore di real wahala wey dey happen for our society, di exchange of all di better tings wey dey happen for dat authorities dem wey dey release television to Western news agency.

Na dis kind openness one group dey go U.S. congress people dis spring.

Instead of Congress aide wey go two hours meeting, Mr. Krenz say e wan listen. Rep. Ronnie Flippo (di, ala), one member of di delegation talk sey e dey very sweet Oga, di way Oga Krenz take dey go East Germany make e change.

He is a very tough man, but one wey dey drag matter also add aide to West German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl.

But Oga, Krenz dey dere.

Born in a Baltic town wey dey now part of Poland, e don dedicate im life to di party apparatus.

E kwik-kwik travel go di ranks with en patron, Oga God Honecker help am, come outside as dem see am.

Barbara Donovan, one sabi for East Germany for Radio Free Europe for Munich, na im talk dis one o, but she no sure sey na correct person e be.

Even if e dey, she add, e appear sey e get limited space wey e take dey maneuver inside Communist Party ruling Politburo.

Against dis background, di new East Germany leader must move sharperly to shook hand for di govnor matter.

Di sudden increase for di opposition wey dey kom out from Poland and Hungary don cause wahala for di country since one anti-viet party party start to dey do im party for 1953.

E no get any honeymoon period o, Western diplomat wey dey East Berlin, but if e sharp, and sharp, e get chance. Di diplomat come add sey Oga, Krenz get plenty tings wey dey follow am.

Germany economy strong pass any other country for East Eufrates.

And im family membas fit help am get anoda fine image wey different from wetin Mr. Honecker dey see as old man.

For average East Germany, Mr. Krenz still dey puzzle sey wheder e no dey real before, or e no dey real now na, one thirty years old East German doctor talk sey anyhow, I get problem wit how quickly e take change.

Doctor dey among plenty people wey dey waka dey waka for East Berlin Gethsemane Church Saturday morning.

Di church wall na leaflets, news clipping, and handwritten notes wit di country political opposition, I must come here read di wall, because na information I still no fit get through di newspapers.

Meanwhile, East Germany dey grow sotay e fit even allow news wey dey reach state level make e for dey funny.

Last week, three weeks wey dem dey do one new report on top East Berlin main wallpaper factory, and di need to boost production.

East Germany remember one comment by some years ago by Kurt Hager wey be government top ideologist, sey just because neighbour dey hang new wallpaper, no get any reason to change your own.

But wetin e mean be sey, East Germany no get anytin to do with all dis tins wey dey happen for Soviet Union.

E no dey clear wheder e wan funny na im di East Berlin shop owner talk, but everyone wey I know, I dey laugh am.
