A letter from Senator John Kerry comechide us today say e get "flip-flip" for Manuel Noriega.

E say e don dey down for Noriega tay, naim im come dey drop criticism on top di attempted coup.

Our October 12 editorial, make e dey precise.

E mean to convey our hope sey Senator, and oder members of Congress don dey make deir dislike Noriega to include oder famous Central American drug runners.

For example, di Sandinistas for Nicaragua too, na part of Castro Medellin cartel nexus.

For di letter wey e send o, and on top of sey e don lose vote dis Tuesday against U.S. aid wey be Nicaraguan opposition, Senator Kerry don clear sey e never do dis kind tin before.

We dey wrong.
