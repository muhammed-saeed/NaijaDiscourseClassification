When im sevent Avenue fur now don dey fly for 20 years, na Jack Purnick get 25 workers, and one big factory.

Naw, di half-worker dey work for eight floor, di place wey e dey talk sey small pass where e dey keep oda tins put.

E say im too dey lose money now.

Im dey blame importation.

But just down for di Sevent Avenue wey be sey de don do about 75% of U.S. fur klot, na dere dem do am, na dere dem dey do am, na dere dem dey do am, na dere dem dey do am, na dere dem dey do am, na dere dem dey do am, na dere dem dey do am.

Im dey credit mehn.

Di difference dey inside how di two oga feada take react to foreign competition, and change of deir industry for di past 10 years.

One stick to old business tradition while di oda one embrace di change.

Oga Purnick sey no be di small, fine salon we dey do, no be di one wey dey use am, na im dey do di best product wey dey di world, and na Americans dey kick kick pass.

Mr. Rosen sef, even if e believe sey importation don reinvigot di one wey e don do for most of im 57 years, you get for here wey no go fit tink small, small.

Importation for U.S. fur fur don hot sotay e don start to dey sell mink wey be sey na di same price wey de dey sell for market for U.S.A.

Many times, people wey dey sell things, dey find wetin dem go take buy mink. Young woman wey dey around 20 years, no even think sey e go fit buy mink.

Di new market come make U.S. take over di money wey dem dey sell for about $1.8 billion a year now wey be sey don pass di level wey dey di market for di last 70 years.

Di ting still open door for South Korea, China, Hong Kong, and oda countries.

Jindo Furs, one big South Korean maker, na im dey do 35 retail outlet for U.S., and plan to open 15 more by di end of next year.

Mr. Purnick, and oder old line, dey call many of di customers wey be sey dey come from una, no be sey una dey come from una hand.

High-end U.S. feada say dis importation never squeeze dem.

But low price, and middle price like Oga Purnick, wey be sey na five block for di sevent Avenue feada, dem talk sey importation don cut deir sales.

One woman wey don save two or three months to buy mink now for di U.S. mall, go sell am for less dan $2.

But Oga, Rosen don con turn di import phenomenon to im advantage.

For di ten years wey don pass, e see sey oyibo people wey dey work for many oda country, dem ready to work wey be sey na small money dem dey pay pass their own oda people wey dey work for dem oda country, and dem ready to do more for dia work.

For 1982, e start one factory for Greece.

After two years, im come open one for West Germany.

E see sey as people dey do foreigner, dem dey do many, many variations for di traditional fury, and e decide to follow suit.

By combining innovation, and quality wit low cost of production abroad, e say e don fit produce high quality goods at low cost.

E talk sey na im dey make most of im vexnashon for inside U.S.

But na six years e take start to dey import from Far East.

Oga God, for importation, Oga God, Rosen dey do vexnashon, hat, and fling.

For dis year, e produce red, blue, violet, royal purpol and forest.

E get fine leather jacket from Turkey wey dem design with eel skin kon dekorate am with fine leather.

From Asia, e get mink jacket wey dem design with floral design.

Next im go dey do one kind embroidery wey dem dey call kalega for Far East.

Im plan na to put di embroidery for back of mink coat, and jacket.

In addition to sales, leather also attract business people wey be sey e go buy fur, e add.

Other vexnashon too don gain from leda.

E get one man wey im name na Seymour Schreibman and na 65 years e dey stay for Schreibman Raphael Furs Inc. E dey work for one side for Persia lamb wey get belle and e dey produce cloth wey nobody fit see.

E dey account for 25% of total sales.

Mr. Rosen too dey do business o.

Dis year e buy two boutique, one for Brooklyn, one for Queens.

Other customers don add weight join wetin dem dey sell.

Golden Feldman Furs Inc. E don dey do business since eight years now, and na about 20% of gross income dem dey sell now.

For oder moves, Oga Rosen talk sey e buy truck three years ago to reach more customers.

Since den e don dey increase im fleet, e dey fit put im vexnashon for front of business people dem wey dey sell for near middle of America.

Small business people wey no fit travel go im New York showroom don start to dey do correct game.

Sey dis kind move don help Oga God, Rosen weather, sey di industry don dey weak.

Na six years dem dey do business before for 1980 but since 1986, dem don dey sell dia $1.8 billion peak.

Some big man wey im name na Antonovich Inc., Fur Vault Inc. and Evans Inc. All of dem wey dem report sey de lose for inside deir new fiscal year.

After impact for di 1987 stock market crash, di list of reasons.

And na competition dey make di market fine, both for skin and klot, sotey e dey reduce price.

Animal rights movement no help sales.

During last two years now, weather don reduce well well, even people wey dey vex, dey complain.

And doz wey no dey go do some of di work for obodo Oyinbo, dey suffer for di hand of labour people, sey di labour wey dem dey do for U.S., de no dey too dey go on top am as e dey before. Oga, Schreibman, wey dey start overseas production.

But even di people wey don find how dem go take manage di import, and slump, dem dey fear sey Fury don dey spoil part of deir allure, sey people dey promote katakata for different, different ways, and dey take di gist comot for di fury. Stephen Sanders, wey be divisional merchandise manager for Marshall Field Department for Chicago, don yarn.

You no fit make commodity out of luxury,‚Äù na so Oga Purnick wey be New York Furrier talk.

E dey talk sey to dey pursue consumers wey dey sell low price, go enter business wey go make people no too send money.

But Oga Rosen talk sey any place wey people wan buy, I go sell am.

Di name of di game na to move goods.
