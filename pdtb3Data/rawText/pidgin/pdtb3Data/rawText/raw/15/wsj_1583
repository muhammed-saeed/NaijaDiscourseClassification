Dis week, many of dem dey carry cut rate, wey be sey de dey announce cut rate, wey be sey de dey carry people fly for some of the most halluted, and slowest day of the year, including Christmas.

For recent years now, airlines don dey wait until last moment wey be sey go enter court for holiday, with price, price, price.
