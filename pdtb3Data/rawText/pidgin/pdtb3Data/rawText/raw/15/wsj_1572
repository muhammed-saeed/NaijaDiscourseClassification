PEOPLE wey dey sleep for up, make una read am.

Dis one na tori about suckers.

Most of us sabi sucker.

Many of us na suckers.

But wetin we go not know, na just wetin dey make person sucker.

Why people dey cut deir credit card number for person wey deir no hear of?

Dem really believe sey di number na just verification, and na just formality on di way to become grandpikin winner?

Why person dey buy oil well from stranger wey dey knock for screen?

Abi you get interest for retirement community for Nevada wey go knock your socks, once de don build?

Because at di end, dese people dey always ask demsef sey how I go take dey foolish?

De get, unfortunately, plenty answer to dat question, and scam artist know all of dem.

Kent Neal wey be di chief of di economic crime unit for Broward County, for Fort Lauderdale, Fla, one major donkey for boiler room, once de don size am, na im de go know how to push.

John Blodgett gree, and e suppose know.

Before, e be boiler room salesman, dey put oil, gas well, rare coins, de get insight of di sale, and different personalities wey you dey pitch different ways.

Di most obvious pitch, of course na di lure of big returns. All of us na little greedy.

Charles Harper, wey be regional administrator for Securities and Exchange Commission for Miami, na im talk sey dis guys na pre on top human frailties.

While di promise of big gain suppose make di bell sound, many times, de no get, because plenty, plenty story na im dey enter American folklore.

Di overnight success story na part of our culture, and we society dey put mouth on top am wit plenty, plenty, and Ed McMahon dey make millionaire out of people, according to University of Kentucky for Louisville. Other people dey make am overnight, and di rest wey dey on top day time no wan miss dat opportunity as e dey come along.

Spencer Barasch wey be di chief for enforcement for SEC wey dey Fort Worth, Texas talk sey: "Why people dey play lottery wen di odds dey high wit dem?

People dey shoot for dream.

E clear sey di way wey scam artist dey do now, no be sey e just dey promise million, but di way of suckers no be sey na yanga wey be greedy.

For example, we need to dey part of di incense.

So one popular ploy na to make prospective investors feel like an insider joining an exclusive group wey wan kill.

For example, for 1978 and 1987, when dem dey sell oil wey dem dey sell for Winter Haven, Fla. Dem sell oil wey dem dey sell give one small group of local people and dem still sell many other big big people.

Di owner of di company, Stephen Smith wey don plead to state and federal fraud charges, confide investors sey im get secret agreement with Amoco oil co, and sey di location of im well dey confidential according to one civil suit wey dem file for Florida State Court for Florida State Court, for Florida State Court.

No be Amoco agreement, no be well, di suit wey dem dey drag o.

Tony Adamski wey be di chief of di financial crime unit for di Federal Bureau of Investigation for Washington, D.C.E., na im dey yarn o sey dis one na true, and sey na one of deir group dem dey give dis opportunity.

At times, sales people go dey embellish di information wit di idea sey dis na some small, small shady, small illegal investment wey dem dey take add di person join.

Di ting wey dey appeal to people wey get small liarity for dia heart, na im di jibiti artist fit do o to insist sey person no go discover imsef, dey keep im victim make e no follow any oda person talk.

Di ting still add to di mystery of di venture.

Oga Blodgett, di boiler room veteran, e believe sey for many investors, di big, big scam wey dey carry heavy load, sey once people enter, I dey allow dem to live dream.

E phone dem wit update on di investment, e say funny tings wey happen dat week, you give dem joy say de no get for deir life.

Blodgett wey dem katch for Florida State Court, wey dey sell unregistered securities, and California State Court of unlawful use of telephone to defraud, and deceive, na im dey on top of probation.

E say e don resign, and im back for school, e dey do psychology wit aspiration to enter into industrial psychology.

Some investors, na di appearance na im dey deceive dem say di trap of success go long, go wear di right clothes, go do di right tins", na so Paul Andreassen wey be associate for psychology for Harvard talk.

E say people go feel say na conservative investment, people go just dey lose small, small investment wey dem no even know sey na yeye investment.

Paul Wennz, one Phoenix, Ariz lawyer, e talk sey di thing wey no dey im hand, go don make am leery.

But Oga wennz wey talk sey e lose $43,000 inside one precious gemal deal, and $39,000 inside anoda one, sey na business man carry am go, dey send investment book, contract wey dey limit di firm liability, and insurance policy.

When e go visit di company office, im talk sey all di trap of legitimacy, na im dem catch am.

Douglas Watson wey be di kommanding officer for di Los Angeles Police Department, na im talk dis one.

Born Born Again, na the best investment wey person fit get, na im dey catch pass.

But no be only dem be dis: di scam wey be sey de dey promise among oda tings to help pipol wey dey live for dis world, to give food to family wey dey star, and make e no dey disappear.

Psychologists talk sey isolated people wey no dey discuss deir investment wit oder people dem, especially deir own risk for fraud.

Kamaru dey find out dis people, or e dey try make deir victims isolate demsef.

Like ehn sales people fit dey vex for one man o sey e wan discuss investment wit im wife, sey who wear di trouser for your family, or person wey be sey na accountant dey tell am sey you be like person wey fit make up im own mind.

Many artists go try to disarm deir victims by emphasizing relationship.

William Lynes wey be retired engineer from Lockheed Corp talk dis one one tori person wey im name na Lily talk sey im and im wife, na investment man wey come from Stuart-James Co, for Atlanta after di broker tell dem sey e don work with Lockheed before.

Lyneses, of Powder Springs, Ga, don enter court for Georgia state court on top Stuart James allegation.

De dey wait for one arbitration proceeding.

De say di broker carry dem out for lunch many, many times.

E say make dem refer to deir friends wey lost money too. Donald Trinen wey be lawyer for di penny broder firm deny di jibiti wey dem dey claim and dem talk sey Lyses too hear sey dem dey pursue high risk investment.

E no dey uncommon for dis guys to send photo of demsef, and deir family to ingratise demsef to dia clients," Terree Bowers, wey be di major fraud section inside di U.S. attorney office for Los Angeles, na im talk sey we don see cases wey be sey sales people go dey affect di area of di country wey de dey call.

Anyting wey you want sell.

Experts talk sey anyting wey person weak, time dey crucial.

People fit dey very vulnerable to flim-flames when de dey among major upheaval in deir life, sometimes when people dey make big changes, dey retire from deir work, dey go new area, de lose deir bearings according to Maurice Elvekrog wey be one investment, and principal for Seger-Elvekrog Inc., one Birmingham, Michael investment firm.

For example, de dey get money withdrawal sef, dey try make deir fixed income, or parents dey worry about how to pay pikin school fees.

Dis people no be sey dem be mumu or naive.

Jerald Jellison wey be psychology professor for University of Southern California for Los Angeles talk sey almost all of us, in relative circumstances, na im de suffer us sometimes.

Nick Cortese tink sey na wetin happen to am be dat.

Mr. Cortese, one 33 years old Delta airplan engineer, e invest some $2,000 for stocks through one broker wey promise quick return, we dey save to buy house, and my wife dey pregnant, na so Oga Cortese talk, na just before Christmas day na im I con plan sey we go fit use extra money, di investment na about $130 today.

E fit be sey na just vulnerable time, Oga Cortese say maybe di next day, or even an hour later, I no go do am.
