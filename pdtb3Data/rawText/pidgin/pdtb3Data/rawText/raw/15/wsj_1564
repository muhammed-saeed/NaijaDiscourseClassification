YOUR investment portfolio risk well well?

First, pop quiz.

When you think of di word risk, and investment, wetin be di specific peril wey dey come your mind?

Pencil down.

If you be like most people, you say na holding wey dey go completely sour maybe na bond wey dey lose, or stock wey deir value drop for a bankruptcy proceeding.

Timothy Kochis, wey be di national director of personal financial planning for accountants Deloitte, Haskins & Sells talk sey people dey face risk well, well.

But e get anoda tin wey dey risk anoda tin: di hazard wey dey shape una propaty sey make una nor put eye for anoda pesin head and make odas nor ponish una.

Dis one nor good for una wey dey sleep like pikin wey dey sleep for nite; una wey dey sleep with una money for six monts naw.

Risk dey wear many many disguise, and investment wey dey low one type of risk fit even high pass wetin dey low.

For example, U.S. Treasury bond, for example, na supersafe when it comes to return money at maturity.

But deir value as investment by force dey reduce bond rate wey dey against bond bond rate.

Rite na also function of time.

When financial professionals dey measure risk maths, de usually focus on di volatility of short term returns.

For example, deposit money dey risk well-well pass Treasury bill, because di way we dey do from good year to bad, dey worse more more.

Dat is usually a standard deviation, or divergence, of annual result from di average return on time.

But investors wey dey hurry up, fit no dey too put eye for anoder big risk. Dem no dey get enough money to take manage long-term financial and life-long goals.

For example, some investors don swear on top stocks since di 1987 market crash, last Friday wey debaculate only add weight.

But di stock market, afta some oda yeye condition, e don dey sell some oda securities for long time.

By retreating to the apparent security of, say money market fund, investors may not be earning enough money to return to a comfortable retirement.

Steven B., one New York financial planner with Seidman Financial Services, na im get di biggest risk of all.

Sake of dis one, financial advisers talk sey dem dey take many steps to assess risk of client portfolio.

Dem dey estimate person wey get im current portfolio go generate over time along with standard deviation wey dey suggest how much di return go dey different year by year.

De dey try to know di long term result wey person need to achieve big goals.

And dem dey do eyeball type wey no dey fit quanta.

Two hypothetical family, one for retirement age, one for income couple wey dey 45 years, all of dem take illustration of risk wey investors need to consider.

For example, di municipal bond wey dey control di husband and wife portfolio, maybe na small part of the money wey dem dey pay wey dey low.

But dem dey expose person wey dey hold dem plenty inflation risk, and intrest risk.

For di younger couple stockholding, na risk of more dan one different stockholder because di money wey dey di front now, na single issue.

See di junior couple portfolio get higher akordin to di yearly return, 101% vs. 8.8% as Seidman Financial Services, wey be di financial planning fund of BDO Seidman.

This one dey show dem how the heavy load wey dem carry dey reach dem.

But one price wey de sell for di higher, na im big pass for di higher level wey Seidman talk about for di younger couple portfolio.

(Dis na how we go take interpret one standard deviation: Take di expected return, add one standard deviation.)

Den take di expected return, add one standard deviation.

For two to three years, na im go just fall within dat range if all di assumptions na true.

Den add two standard deviation so dat de go get wider range.

De get 95% probability of any year result for di range.

Of course di level wey be sey di younger couple portfolio get evritin, e no mean sey dem dey risk di money wey be sey dey hold di people wey be sey de wan do dia own.

True true, di old couple portfolio fit even risk more dan sey di money wey dem dey expect no go generate enough money to take manage wetin dem dey spend.

E fit be sey de feel sey de no too dey sell stock market, na im John H. Kammack wey be financial planner with Alexandra Armstrong advisers Inc, for Washington, but de fit pay 10, or 20 years for future.

Ms. Slater talk on top personal finance matter from di Wall Street Journals New York bureau o.

When it comes to investing, trying to balance risk, and reward, e be like sey person dey throw big money, no know di actual money wey securities go deliver, or di up, and down wey go happen along di way.

Looking back to olden days fit give person clue.

For many years like dis, investors wey dey take stock market gyration collect plenty, plenty money pass di ones wey dey on top di bonds, and investment like Treasury bill.

But wetin history fit suggest na im make sense to expect sey no be every kain go dey again.

Like some analysts, de believe sey bondage, and volatility don move go near di stock market well, well.

And money wey person dey carry on top bank account fit continue to dey increase pass as e dey before.

Portfolio A: Retired husband and wife, aged 65, $400,000 portfolio.

Portfolio B: two income couple, age 45, $150,000 portfolio.
