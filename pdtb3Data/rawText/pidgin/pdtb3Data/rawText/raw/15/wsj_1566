:.START

THROUGH 1980, investors don dey find creative alternative to traditional method of financial planning.

Capital don dey democratized, and people want enter.

But many times, small investors dey comot wit di same story wey dey appeal to before generations of fiduciary strategists.

But naw, make una start to dey borrow una money, so dat una nor go too put eye for big-big tins. Make una plan well-well, so dat una nor go wound. Dis na wetin go happen to pipol wey dey vex, bikos dem nor fit do anytin with dia life.

You know who you be.

My revolutionary system also dey useful for people wey don try how dem dey take grow deir currency cushion.

Like all Americans wey dey find chronic better better, I dey find am necessary to put some kind money into things wey be sey na only to give my inlaw my wife, wey dey believe am.

So throughout di ten years, I have maintained my pension account, and CD, and think of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and keep my position in di residential real estate market.

Turn down dis your fine portfolio now wey you know sey e no get negative.

Figure 1 show sey di business wey I invest for dis decade, see accompanying illustration WSJ October 20, 1989.

Oil bunkering suffer big well well until I divet all dose stocks for 1985. At dat point, no be sey dem dey light all dis Christmas tree, so e no come get power again.

Similarly, mutual funds remain small till I do wetin dey, for me, na serious investment.

By 1987, dis property na tailpin causing my broker for Pru-Bache to remark sey she no go see anytin wey be like am. Concerning her state of mind, I drop dem, and di market immediately begin dey stabilize.

E fit be sey na di biggest event wey happen for metropolitan New York real-estate market, wey dey boom till I enter am for 1988, wey be sey na di first negative compound increase for years.

Di ting wey I do, disguaged, I do another way to plan my asset, no heavy breeze wey I take dey breath di answer give me, I dey do am now, all of us don get money to spend, some of am na jara wey we take dey waste am.

Bank am?

No be now, carry am troway for long term?

Nansense, na di best investment wey person fit get every day!

Your priorities may be different, but in Figure 2 I have chosen to build for future, personal space, automotive, children toys, bulbs, bulbs, and finally, entertainment, maybe the best investment of all.

All of dem don give me double number every year and dem still dey provide big, big potential.

At least according to my calculation.

Personal space (like figure 3) don grow 35% every year for di decade, one performance wey go compare positively wit investment say, synthetic leather products for inside house of cold weather, wey my cousin enter inside and e dey regret now.

Di range of expensive children toys wey I buy for one house wey dem dey call down, show sey e don increase inside all di money wey be sey na im dey di record, wey be sey maybe na my record, wey be sey e dey safe to talk sey, e no get community.

De continue investment for my 1984 subcompact don dey part of my strategy (Figure 5), dey present annual contribution now, e don pass 60% on top of di motor.

According to wetin I calculate, dis one go don carry di money of my car price to more dan $22,000 for market figure 6 wey I wan sell am soon.

The time wey I no dey house again don make am hard for me to build better house, better grass, better wood, better wood, and better tree.

I don do wetin I fit do to make sure sey my house and house no go dry.

My initial stake for dis blooming enterprise don grow ten times wit my own conservative calculation.

At di same time, I dey do different type of entertainment, wey be sey na di same time I take do am. Maybe na di same time I take do am for person wey dey creative, wey be sey naim I take do am.

For di decade afta, for example, di way we take spend on investment for only poker (Figures 7a and 7b) don dey impress us well, well, e don show us betta yearly expansion wey be sey na di way wey my friends dey play now be sey na 1990 and beyond.

With dis my own strategy, I dey look forward to many kain investment wey I dey do for dis life, and di more we dey use am, di more we go dey use am.

My children go go school go reach like dat for future o, but maybe I go need to cash for deir toy portfolio to carry am.

But wit every step wey I take, I dey build wealth.

You fit too, if you, like me, no gree bite bullet.

So go dere go chop dat debt.

You dey dere for di mainstream of American business, building price for back of insupportable expenditure.

Henry Kravis, watch out!
