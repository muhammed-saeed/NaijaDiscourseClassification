WHEN JAMES SCHWARTZ just dey leave im papa give am career advice, e tell me sey make I choose one place wey be sey, if to say I dey mediocre, I for dey great naw. Oga, Schwartz, now 40.

E try management consulting, e trade turquoise for some time, e even try professional wrestler.

Now im don settle into one career wey fit pay bill.

Di one wey be sey Oga, Schwartz wey dey operate for Englewood, Colo, na puckish di person dey like to dey give im colleagues di needle.

But dis one wey di needle dey do, e dey sharp well, well.

Though it may be safe to assume sey most of the financial planners na person wey dey honest, and even very competent, di fact remain sey, as one wag dey talk sey person wey fit fox mirror fit call imsef financial planner.

Plans now dey influence investment of several hundred billion dollars, but in effect, dem dey operate for darkness.

De no get better regulation, de no accept admission into deir level, one dog enter one trade group. De no dey assess dem performance, no dey even know how many of dem dey (estimmates range from 60,000 to 450,000)...

All di people need to do na shingle, and start to dey plan.

So e no go surprise us sey di work, if na wetin e be, e don attract plenty people wey be sey deir chief na thief, or dey tief deir clients money.

Alarmed, state, and federal government don dey try to devise ways to take certify, and regulate planners.

Industrial groups, and respected planners dem wey be sey de don taya to see people wey dey do jibiti, wey dey do jibiti, wey dey do jibiti, wey dey do jibiti, wey dey do jibiti, wey dey do jibiti, wey dey do jibiti, wey dey do jibiti.

But reform never hold hold, di industry still dey very big for di wild West days wey be sey na Scott Stapf wey be di director of investor education for North American Securities Administrators Association.

One limited study wey na from NASAA wey be state securities regulator, dem find out sey between 1986, 1988, fraudulent and abuse, na 22,000 investors invest inside.

For di rogues gallery of planners including some convicted felon, compulsive gambler, or two different business men wey plan deir own before dem enter bankruptcy, and one man wey sama im wife mama.

Wetin remain, di losses wey dem, and di oda ones, na just wetin we just dey fall on, na im Oga, Stapf dey add sey most of dis tins probably dey unaccounted for.

So just take over all di loss wey be sey na sheer incompetence of una no qualifier.

Nobody fit estimate tollll, but John Gargan, Tampa, Fla, planner, and di head of one trade group, International Association of Registered Financial Planners, na dem dey reason di danger to investors wey dey incompetent, far pass di one wey crookery dey.

Im group like oders, de wan reduce how de dey call demsef financial planner.

After dey do all dis one, some people now dey feel sey better planner no dey plan at all.

For most investors, di benefit no just worth di risk," Barbara Roper wey dey follow financial plan for Consumer Federation of America, one consumer advocate wey dey Washington, dey talk.

She concedes dat such a position is unfair to di thousands of qualified, qualified people wey dey do di trade, but as a consumer advocate, she feel impelled to take am.

She say her group don give tips on top planning, and experience credentials, go meet regulators, and better business bureaus, but dem find out sey even some people wey carry dis step, de still dey fall.

But di bad news no be di one wey kill di growing demand for financial planning.

Tax reform act of 1986 wey bin comot many tax shelter wey dey run by planners, and stock market crash di next year na im cause sharp sharp increase for di demand, and many planners gats gats to take unplanned exit from business.

But membership for International Association of Financial Plannings (IAFP), di biggest trading group for di industry, na almost triple wetin e be for 1980, and dem dey believe sey number of planners wey no belong to any group don plenty well, well.

An estimated 10 million Americans now dey use financial planner, and pool of capital dey influence big, big.

One of di 54,000 wey di AFP talk about for April, show sey na only dem dem take dey control, or guide di investment of $154 billion wey deir client spend inside di last 12 months.

Di sheer number of planners dey make di business, if not impossible, to regulate.

Even di minority of dem wey be sey de must register with di Securities and Exchange Commission as investment adviser, people wey be sey de dey advise, or dey sell securities, all of dem don do enough to swamp di agency capacity.

Sey na only about 200 staff wey dem don assign to keep tabernacle for investment advisers, about di same amount wey dey di same amount for 1980 na di same as di one wey di advisers don do for di last ten years.

Currently, registered investment adviser dey expect SEC audit only once every 12 years.

Kathryn McGrath wey be di SEC division of investment management talk sey dis kind bad ting dey happen for 12 years.

So di SEC don dey propose to congress say much of di work wey dem dey do on top of dia head, na im dem dey do for one industry, dem dey call am self-regulatory organisation like National Association of Securities Dealers wey be sey na im dey do di broker business.

This kind organization fit, among other tings, set standard wey dey regulate competence, ethics, finances, and punish people wey be investment advisers wey dey break di law.

Di proposal don spark one big debate inside one industry wey far from United to begin with.

Mr. Schwartz wey be di puckish planner for Englewood, Colo, na im talk sey to dey allow di business demsef to police sef, na like sey na Dracula dey take charge of blood bank, na im be di Tampa planner wey be sey na just dey assess industry, dey give more staff.

(Mr.

Gargan view no dey welcome visitors well, well for IAFP wey be di major industry organization.

When di IAFP just arrange other industry group to talk about common standard wey person fit dey follow, Oga Gargan, dem add am join.

Dat one fit be sey Oga Gargan, dey smart for wetin e dey talk about im membership level wey rival group dey do, e come put im dog, Beauregard as Iafa member wey be Iafa, na im come send di picture wit di certificate of membership wey be sey na Booris bo'Regaard to every newspaper wey e fit tink of.

Di states get deir own thinking on regulation, and certification.

NASA, di organisation of state securities regulators, na im dey push for one kind regulatory statute wey don dey ground since eight states.

It requires financial planners to register wit state, competence test, and reveal to customers any clash of interest.

Di most common quarrel, na to compensate.

NASAA talk sey almost 90% of planner dey receive some, or all of dem income from sales commission on top securities, insurance, and oder financial product wey dem dey recommend.

Di matter be sey di plan put im client inside di best investment, abi di one wey get di biggest commission?

For 1986, New York attorney general release one state court for Albany wey shut down First Circumcism, one Albany bank, wey invest $55 million on top of almost 1,000 investors.

In di notice of action, di attorney general say di company don promise to put clients inside 'balanced' investment portfolio, instead, di attorney general alleged sey di company dey always push unwar customer into high risk investment of paintings, coins, and Florida condos.

Dose investment don pay big commission to First Meridian, payment company dem no yarn o, di attorney general alleged.

Investors dey sure sey na only people wey get small net go fit enter God Kingdom.

In practice, di attorney general alleged in an affidavit, if investor get right to collect cash, di chances of being turned down by First Meridian, dem dey likely say dem dey rejected by di Book of the Month Club.

And, di general add, First Meridian Presido, Roger V. Sala, e con portray imsef as fincial expert when im go school mostly, mostly, im go do high school diploma, work as a state, and insurance salesman, and a stint as overseer for one highway toll booth.

First Mechanic, and im officials dem dey now under investigation on top possible criminal offence according to one spokeswoman for di attorney general.

Harry Manion, Oga Sala attorney, e dey yarn sey im client deny any wrong, and e add sey di lawyer general dey yarn sey First Meridian business dey wrong.

As for Mr. Sala don qualify, di snoo lawyer for state of New York con decide sey Mr. Sala no qualify because im no get Harvard.

Devil dey sue planners by clients wey dey seek to recover money.

Di two koko wey dem file before dis year for Georgia State Court for Atlanta, fit dey very embarrassing for di industry na: J. Chandler Peterson wey be Atlanta financial planner wey be founder and former chairman of IAFP.

One suit wey dem file by more than three dozen investors, charges wey be sey Oga Peterson use much of di $9.7 million take enter limited partnership wey e do, wey be sey e do am to pay im own legal bill, and to invest for oder companies wey e get interest.

Dose companies too, de pay Oga Peterson commission, and fee, di suit alleges.

Di oder one wey two men file for one lawsuit on top $100,000 investment, each one wey dem dey drag wit Mr. Peterson as part of one attempt to buy di Bank of Scottsdale for Arizona, Ariz.

One plaintiff, one doctor, testify for one affidavit sey e too give Oga Peterson $50,000 to join one kind investment club wey basically give di doctor di opportunity to make additional investment wit Oga Peterson.

For affidavit, each plaintiff, e dey claim sey Mr. Peterson promise sey di bank go complete by di end of 1988, or di money go return.

Mr. Peterson carry di plaintiff, and oder investors money go meet di bank oga dem.

Wit di tori person, Myron Diebel wey be di bank president, e carry one business suit, di western style, and di boot, e come open im briefcase, come add one million naira on top tabol for front of directors, na im e say na to show di money wey e get, na im e talk am.

But di bank oga dem show am di door, di sale never come out.

According to di suit, Oga Peterson never return di plaintiff investment.

De want am back.

Oga Peterson drop down to comment on top specific allegations inside di two suit ah say e prefer to save such response for court.

But e dey talk sey all im work don dey entirely.

Ontop di suit by limited partner, e say im dey reason defamation suit against di plaintiff.

Di suit, e add e say almost in di nature of vendetta by some disgrunted people.

Wit di suit on top di bank bid, Mr. Peterson talk sey na inflammatory language and half truth full am, e no gree enter specific ting.

Oga Peterson talk sey di sue against am no be small work wey im dey do dan sey na sign of di times wey people dey quick carry sue sey I no know anybody wey be sey e never do any trial.

Oga Peterson too yarn sey im no dey consider imsef again as financial planner.

E con call imsef an investment banker.

Many, or some kind of scam wey be sey de dey involve planner, na evamination of common sense on di part of di investors dem go avoid.

Use am, no proessional hesitate to pay ten thousand naira just take invest with planner?

Oda kase still dey to show sey old one, if e too good to dey true, e fit bi sey na true.

Employee wey dey collect money no dey pay 23% a year for example, but dat one no stop clients of one Alabama planner.

Now na dem be laxer, and e dey for prison for Mobile County.

DELEGATE wey dey yield 40% sef, even dis one wey dey issue issue for Marshall Island, na only mail drop wey one local gas station operator dey take watch am, but investors too suffer for dat one.

And Colorado planner wey bin yarn sey im go do some of im clients millionaire on investment of as little as $100?

No mind!

You don know di answer.
