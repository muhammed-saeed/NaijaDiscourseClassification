For di same time, di way we take lose, with slow tok, come make some people wey be securities analyst dey wonder weda e go strong well, well for computer wey be sey dey protect imself from evritin wey dey happen.

Unisys is now clobered.

Ulric Weil wey be analyst for Weil & Associates wey don dey top di company before, talk sey di quarter na aha, and di future dey look anyhow aha.

DISUNIS wey get revenue of about 37% from di quarter to $2.35 billion from di $2.27 billion wey dey di year allocation, lose about 30 million a year.

On top dat one, di Blue Bell, Pa take charge of $230 million naira on top di layoff of 8,000 workers.

Dat one na di highest level of di range of 7,000 to 8,000 workers wey Unisys talk sey one month ago, dem go kill am.

Unisys talk sey make dem save $500 million a year for inside cost again, again at di high end of di former wey de talk sey na $400 million to $500 million.

Di company too take write of $150 million to cover loss on top some fixed price defense contract as some new managers take chook eye on top di possibility sey dis slow growth business go continue.

Also, Unisys bin set up one special reserve like dis wey be sey na like $60 million to $70 million to cover di minimal money wey be sey e go pay government because of wetin dey inside di defence procurement matter.

Unisys also note sey di tax wey de pay na $78 million even though sey tax wey dey normal, na small money inside di quarter na im cause dis big loss.

Tax go leave Unisys wit $225 million in loss carry forward wey go reduce tax matter for future quarters.

In addition, Unisys talk sey e go reduce computer inventors a further $100 million during di quarter, e go drop am within $100 million of im goal to reduce $500 million by di end of di year.

Still, Unisys talk sey dis one wey be sey de dey weak for di quarter, one bad sign wey be sey di company don dey rely on solid result wey dey globally to make am stronger for di U.S. over wetin don happen before.

Di company too dey report sey di slow growth for anoder important business na di one wey be sey dey use Unix operating system.

Dat one go be big wahala if e continue because Unisys dey sell im business on top di assumption sey customers wan use only one machine dey run ontop only one machine, and towards systems mainly Unix, wey be sey na almost anybody machine na im dey do dat one.

Also, Unisys must deal with di xension wey dey too much for am.

Debt don climb reach around $4 billion, or about 50% of total capitalisation.

Dat means, Uniport must pay about $100 million in intrest into di interest of every quarter on top of $27 million in dividend on preferred stock.

Jim Unruh, Unisys president talk sey im dey enter next year wit caution.

E say di pawa wey dey di world wide economy na suspect, and e no dey see as di card dey grow well, well.

E still talk sey di money wey dem dey sell for computer side go continue next year.

E say di move to standard operating system mean sey customers no dey lock to buy from deir traditional computer supplier, and dem fit dey price low.

Dat one, e con talk sey na why Unisys dey do en own business, e need to prepare for world wey be sey de go dey priceless pass computer company.

We don approach dis one no be sey we wan do temporary condition for di industry, but na fundamental change we wan do for di industry na im ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn.

But we no dey minimize di challenges of di near term.

Security analyst even dey cautious as dem burn am many times for Unisys this year.

Some don predict share of more than $4 per cent for dis year, till last year own wey be sey de don drop di total of $3.27 wey be sey de dey di whole money wey be sey de dey di bottom of di list of earnings wey be sey de don dey drop more than $680.6 million.

But di company yarn am on Friday sey e lose $672.3 million a year after di first nine months wey dem dey spend on top salary of $382.2 million, or $2.22 billion wey dem dey share share well, well, as e dey run up to $7.13 billion from di $7.03 billion.

And Unisys is expected to do little better even in di fourth quarter.

So Steve Milunovich for First Boston talk sey e dey cut im earnings estimate next year to $2 a share from $3, I con dey feel sey I too much to start with, e con talk.

Oga Weil of Weil & Associates talk sey im go remain at $1 a share for next year, but e come dey wonder sey even dat low target dey at risk, sey even dat low one dey fall for di next year.

When e dey inside di matter, na im UNIS stock fall to $16.25 for inside composite trading on Friday for New York Stock Exchange.
