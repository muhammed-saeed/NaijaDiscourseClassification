World get one big yoke recently wen Soviets talk sey one kind rash of UFO land, one of dem carry big, big alien wey fall for darkness go Voronezh.

Timothy Good wey be di author of di book Above On Secret, di World UFO Cover Up (quesill, William Morrow, 592 pages, $12.95), di world wey dey quick dey laugh.

E get one Bible for UFO, complete wey talk sey dem don get personal relationship with aliens.

One photo show one woman wey dey wear scar, wey e say na laser beam na im dey see di wound.

But e be like sey awa visitor dey only bring lite for awa kloud and e dey shine well-well.

Oga Good dedicate big time to di tins wey dey happen for Feb. 25, 1942 when American gunners see new light for sky above Los Angeles.

Dem blow di alarm for 2 : 25 a.m., bring 12,000 air warden wey go dey duty.

E no tey again, hell-fire start to burn.

Di round battery wey dey carry one small, small aeroplane wey dey fly go very, very speed, come give fire wey dey vex.

Shell use 12.8 pounds take make di sky and some of am fall for groun. Dem scatter house and building rish groun.

Wen di smoke don komot, six pipol die (three from dia heart attack) and evribody kon dey wonder wetin dey happen for di world wey dem dey shoot.

Oga good, who document dis ting as e fit do, e provide di official explanation in di form of a memorandum from di Chief of Staff George C. Marshall to President Roosevelt: 1,430 pounds of ammunition, e write di commander in chief, expend on top of unidentified aircraft, dey fly fast, fast like 200 mph and elevation of between 9,000 and 18,000 feet.

Ehn thousands of Californians wey dey di scene, dey insist on top di Ammo, for big, big UFO, but you go just carry judgement on top of dis kind sight.

One tin wey I know bi sey: Many pipol dey der and dem plenty pass di leaders for National Enquirer.

Gerald Ford, one very downto-earth fellow, once e don send one letter to di chairman of di Armed Services Committee afta dem say na committee dem go do di UFO phenomenon.

I think we owe American people to establish credibility on UFO and to produce di greatest possible insight on top di matter.

Jimmy Carter go further for one 1976 campaign promise say if I become president, I go make every information wey dey dis country give public eye, and scientists.

I dey sure sey UFO dey exist because I don see one....

But you know about campaign promise.

E still no be like government dey cough up everytin wey dem know.

Still, despite deir attempts to convince di world sey na only us dey, di visitors still dey come, like di recent sight wey dey, some detail, some two tings dey wey show sey dem be like sey na small ting for dumb side.

For example, for Voronez time, some people wey behemoth and robot friend dey waka anyhow around di city park, come leave some rock dere.

Na why you go ask yoursef sey person wey wise go carry plenty rock dey waka for di universe?

Or land for Russia many, many times.

For one 1961 incident, one Soviet mail plane just disappear comot for di radar screen just after im position to ground control for Sverdlovlovsk.

One man wey e name na Edith Brenisen, wey dey inside forest, see aeroplane wey no fall small.

Di seven people wey dey inside di ship dey miss.

Again you have to ask the obvious question: Why intelligent being go kidnap seven Russian mailmen?

Di debate on top di matter of aliens go continue until we wake up one morning to find out sey dem don win di Today show, di way dem take win one full town for inside Jack Finney house (wey be Simon & Schuster), 216 page, $8.95)

Maybe some of our talk show host, and anchor don already come out?

Di point wey dey dis 1955 novel wey cause two movie na sey di soulless pod dey very, very different from human being.

Anoder person wey dey tink sey de dey dere, and closing now, na Whitley Swirer wey im new novel, putnam 317 pages, $18.95, na im dey yarn sey na 1947 UFO crash near Roswell Army Air Field for New Mexico desert.

Mr. Swirder know very much about aliens.

E even do one, and no be by mistake, as readers dey learn for im Comunion (wey just describe am for New York Times as Nonfiction best seller).

Di way wey be sey Oga Swirder dey yarn for inside im oga hand, di intelligence officer wey see di ting wey be sey na small, small tin, na im government come force to call di inbuilt insignificant part of a weather balloon.

Dis crash wey dem dey plan so, kon bi one of di best tins wey don happen and di wiked tins wey human being dey do, kon dey make dem vex.

We lose our chance to talk to visitors wey dey behave well, wey be sey na puffed up marshmallow make dem.
