No Let People Mistake Make You Stop to Serve Jehovah

Men dey Do Chores

WHEN HusbandDS start to do more work, dem dey do work wey di children dey do instead of di wife.

One man wey study law well well, wey im name na Linda Waite and Frances Goldscheider, talk about one small number of women wey don marry wey get at least one pikin between six and 18 years for house

Di women dey tell us which family member dey do different house work, and how dem take dey share am.

Woman wey nor dey do anytin for life, weda e dey work or e nor work, naim e dey do pass: about 80% of di tins wey wi dey do, weda na to dey wosh or kook, na about two times evriday for di house wey wi dey wosh plate, pikin and family paper.

Woman dey only do yard work, dey do house maintenance, no be half of wetin di woman dey do.

But dem talk sey while children dey do family matter, make di mama no too suffer, di husband go come dey help give di pikin light for one, one for one, and to reduce di wife work wey she suppose do, na to just do am small, small.

This kind thing dey among people wey go school well well.

For dis family, husbands do 80% work pass for couples wey dey do only grammar school.

But di pikin wey go school, get six eighteen thousand, pass di ones wey dey small.

E clear, Ms. Waite talk sey most of di effect of increase for education na to shift who dey help di wife, and mama.

Her share dey decrease, but only small.

APOSTLE PAUL, wey be nursing home, dem dey tief demsef pass wetin dem dey believe before two new study talk sey.

State governments dey put very low ceiling on top how much property people may own, or how much income dem fit keep if dem wan benefit from medical bill.

Convention wisdom don dey hold sey anywhere from one fourth to one half of all old long, long care patients, de must put demsef for poverty before dey qualify for Medicaid help.

But a very high percentage (over half) na private payers dey do throughout deir stay even a very long one.

Dem dey pay one out of every three out of their own pocket while di rest dey covered by Medicare, private insurer, or the Veterans Administration.

Di report na from one thousand patients wey dem sample for one 1985 nationwide government study.

But Brookings and Urban Institute people wey dey dere, de warn sey most nursing home na from small, small time now, and reach Medicaid level, e fit be sey di number of stay, na im many, many, many stay.

And in addition, de note, people wey dey manage deir own way, na only when dem sell deir house, dey use up life savings, dey draw on top children, and oder family members.
