E get peace for dis part of western India.

Di dry sizin, de don harvest, di sizin still dey tay.

Farisee pipol wey dey sell ajebo and fine ear-fine klot dey always laf and yeye for market.

You think sey na one kind lull e go be for Arabia people life before oil price go come down?

Just as Arab pipol dey for Egypt for 1960, na so too Sidhpur farmers dey for di world pawa and pipol go dey tok about am.

Arab people get only oil.

“E fit bi sey dis farmers dey struggol well-well for dis world.

Or at least, e get heart disease.

Dat one na because Sidhpur get one near monopoly for di world wey dem dey sell flea seed, alias flea wort, or for Western parlance, psyllium. Small, small seed wey dey taste well, well, according to early research, e fit reduce blood pressure.

Ever since dem reveal cholesterol, Americans don begin scarfling psyllium for deir breakfast cereal.

If further research na to find out wetin di seed produce, den di farm district fit dey among di fads wey get money pass oda fads wey dey produce food.

Dis na di seed wey never grow for any oda place for India, or for any oda place for di world, na im T.V. Krishnamurty wey be di Vice Presido for Procter & Gamble India Ltd, talk sey di weather no dey eazy for many places for di world. Arvind Patel, wey be sey de dey process di seed, go talk sey if na oyibo dey take di place of Oat bran, e go big.

Whether psyllium make Sidhpur fortune, e depend on top cholesterol cholesterol, di U.S. Food, and Drug administration, and of course di result of further research.

“One tin dey here wey bi sey: Pysllium go remain only one tin wey bi Sidhpur own tey.

Local farmers say it is good cash crop, or fenugreek, a legume.

But dem no wan chop psyllium every morning and maybe na small nid: lean, frugal, farmers, nidol, nidol, nidol, nidol.

Psyllium na annual herb, Plantago ovata wey people don dey use for many years for here, mostly laxative, anti-diarrheal.

As e be like dis, di soluble fiber get almost complete leg like dat for northern India ah, I can assure you at least, at least one 25 years old lawyer for New Delhi, wit better eyebrow, from personal experience, e dey work. One prominent business man for Bombay talk sey na so I dey do am everyday o, sey I dey do am everyday o, sey I dey do am everyday o, sey I dey do am everyday o, sey I dey do am everyday o, dey do am kidney, sperm, sperm, and hemorrhoids.

Some dey do am for gout joint.

The seed get hair and e dey produce small small seed.

Di seed no get colour, and size o, one of dem na only 1.5 grams, or about two paper clips na im de explain di historical allusions to fleas.

Dem go skata di seed kon tear am to pieces. Animals go chop di seed too.

Some 90% of di crop wey be sey na $26 million last year, de dey export am.

For many years now, psyllium husk don be di main ingredient for dis kind laxing like procter & Gamble Co, di highest selling market for U.S. and Ciba-Geigy Corp.

But before now, some people don see sey soluble fibres also reduce cholesterol.

Cincinnatinati-P&G bring out interest, e order two study on psyllium and cholesterol.

One of di study wey dem do for University of Minnesota, e test 75 people wey get elevated cholesterol level.

After 16 weeks, di group wey carry three daily teaspoon of Metamucil see big difference for deir general cholesterol level, and even greater reduction for low density lipomymy, wey dem dey call bad cholesterol.

For 1987, P&G tell FDA make dem give dem the right to buy medicine tablet wey get cholesterol (bikos na im be the first cream wey dem dey sell for market).

For April, psyllium bandwagon kon plenty pass before.

General Mills Inc, di food giant don launch one breakfast cereal wey dem dey call Benefit, containing psyllium, oat, wheat, and beet bran, di word na im dey prominent for inside di package.

For September, Kellogg Co. launch one competing psyllium capsule wey dem dey call Heartwise.

Suddenly, for television, for advert, and for deir cereal box, Americans too begin dey para on top of di obscure seed.

Flood of claim, and counterclaimer, and e dey even make di new cereal dey pain.

Dis month, di Food and Drug Administration don dey worry sey America might someday, for different kind of psyllium.

Currently, e get one lull for psyllium war.

FDA don tell Kellogg and General Mills make dem do research say deir cereal dey safe.

De don order P&G make dem produce more study o, buttress say Metamucil fit reduce cholesterol.

But di agency never yanked psyllium wey dey comot for inside shop.

If FDA approve di new use of psyllium, oder companies go come rush go market with psyllium product.

Oga, Krishnamurthy of P&G for inside bombay.

psyllium exporter, Mr. Patel, I just come back yesterday from U.S.

For inside newspaper, for radio, and TV, psyllium everywhere.

But di news about di boom still dey deceive pipol wey dey plant.

De just know of one use of di crop, as a laxative, and psyllium price wey dey now for bumper crop, de dey see di seed as ajebo, ajebo, ajebo.

Sooraji Jat, wey be 26 years, wey dey farm for Lakshmipura, na im dey yarn dis one sey rain dey fall for di correct time, di crop don spoil.

Even for di Basic Chemicals, and Pharmaceuticals, and Cosmetics, di government agency wey dey promote di seed, di psyllium boom, e dey far.

Staff dey brag about psyllium contribution to American regularity without fully understanding di implications of di research on cholesterol.

Di council annual report get psyllium on top di last page, lumpy with dis yeye export items like sarsaparilla, and Nux, a plant wey dey induce vomiting.

One way wey psyllum middle people, doz wey dey sell, doz wey dey sell, dey happy well-well as dem dey hear di boom wey dey happen.

De wan psyllium low for deir buy next year.

But catch dey.

Siddpur and adjacent districts na di only place for di world wey psyllium dey plenty well, well.

Dis one na partly due to di particular demands wey di farmers dey carry.

Psyllium need san-san; dew must fall for some weeks before e go grow well.

Small gragra dey grow for Pakistan, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Brazil, but dia kain quality no dey compare wit dat of Indian psyllium.

Big traders like procter & Gamble talk sey e get oder spots wey dey for di world, and for India, where di seed go grow, no be times two, or times three, na so Oga God tok.

But no one don do serious try to transplant di crop.

Siddpur don almost finish pipol harvest dis year.

Many farmers wey dey far from where dem for dey dig psyllium, don decide to plant mustard, fennel, cumin, fenuek, or castor-oil seed.

Mr. Jat dey reason to do psyllium every year for favour of crop, like cumin, or fennel, maybe I go plant castor-oil seed. Im broder, Parkhaji wey deir head dey stamped in fine crimson turban, nodo sharperly.

So di next year wey dem dey harvest psyllium, e go small pass di 16,000 metric tons wey don dey since some years now, right on top of psyllium boom.

And di world fit suffer for di first psyllium.
