Market man for Nasdaq on top di counter area dey para sey make dem stop to dey sell tins.

But dia motivation, e get one kind tin wey be sey, programme wey be sey dey sell, e dey risk deir money.

Di most popular programme wey dey do business, stock index arbitration, na im dey make am tough for tradas to make money,” na Robert Antolini wey be di Head of OTC, for Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette na im dey yarn dis one.

For example, dem dey call am “ stock index index index ” or “ stock index index index index wey dey buy and sell stocks. Dem dey call am stock index wey dey sell stock pass wetin dey sell for stock market. Dem dey use di 31 stock index wey dey Standard and Poor Poor Index.

Di portion wey dey OTC volume to dey do trading no dey eazy for di New York Stock Exchange as e don increase to more than 13% for September.

This one na 133 million evriday for Nasdaq people own.

Other market person wey dey sell something also cause Nasdaq composite index to fall on top any oda part of di stock market.

Because dem dey sell OTC stock wey no get sharp price, dat na wetin dem dey call liquidity.

Also, di price wey be sey de dey sell, de dey cut stone to push individual investors back to one OTC market wey be sey de dey buy dem.

Some of dis wahala no be new one, and no be only OTC market.

But di big tin wey dey happen for market last month, don make some pipol dey gain from di bad tins wey dem dey do.

Peter Dapuzzo, wey be head of business, wey be sey na Shearson Lehman Hutton, na im talk am when e start to dey sell for precious bull market because e don add liquidity, and people dey happy sey stock price don dey climb.

We no dey worry until de sell programme, Oga Dapuzzo now wey dey tink sey na jara e dey add.

But Shearson Lehman dey do programme for clients.

Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Kidd Peabody, plus Shearson, dey sell OTC stock.

Shearson, Merrill Lynch, and Goldman Sachs say na only customers dem dey do am.

Kaider Peabody dey sell im own business, and clients account.

Na true sey de dey sell some kind things before, but dis days, e dey pain us wey dey sell market.

Dat one na mostly because of defensive measures wey dem adopt after 1987 crash, when individual investors run leave di market, come dey sell activity.

Market man, to reduce cost, slashed investment investors when oder people no dey sell.

And to protect deir reduced capital investment from roding to rod again, deir traders sharperly reduce deir price when de dey sell deir programme.

When price don dey shake, dem go ready to buy share from people wey dey sell, when no one go buy.

For dat kind place, market people wey dey do business, dey suffer for business wey dey slow down, and deir inventors dey suffer for di same day.

E no make sense for us to risk money wen you know sey you go lose,” na so Oga Antolini wey be Donaldson Lufkin talk.

But dis skittiness wey Oga Antolini talk, e dey create liquidity palava for some OTC stock wey be sey e go hard to sell stocks when de dey come because sey some market people no wan carry di order.

No one get big position, no one wan take big risk.

Joseph Hardiman, wey be president of National Association of Securities Dealers, wey be sey na dem dey do di trading on top Nasdaq, e gree sey di market matter dey cause small investment.

But e dey observe, while makers dey suffer for sey deir programme dey drag di market down, dem dey still make money when deir programme dey push di price higher, sey sometimes 12 tradas de lose sight of dat one.12

Dis big stocks dey influence Nasdaq Component Index.

When computer say dey sell, di composite tumbler, and di Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Di problem, market makers talk sey while industrial average, S&P 500 dey normally recover when dem dey buy programme, na Nasdaq composite dey always come out.

For October, na eight days after di stock market fall, for di day before di stock market fall, na im Nasdaq composite come drop 4.3%, compare wit 3.3% for S&P 500, 3.5% for New York Stock Exchange Commite, and 3.6% for Industrial Average.
