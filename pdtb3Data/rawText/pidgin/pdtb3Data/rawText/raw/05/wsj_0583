Polly Peck International Inc. go collect 51% on top sansui electric co, e show sey foreign company fit take over Japanese company if di alternative for di Japanese company don expire.

Polis Peck, one big Britain conglomerate wey dey grow well, go pay 15.6 billion yen ($110 million) for 39 million new share of sansui, one company wey dem dey call Sansui, wey be one of the best people for the world, wey no dey change market condition.

Japan government sabi dey ready to resign, but Japan government don deny Japan investment for overseas sake of sey dem dey take am like sey na proof like dat for Japan.

Peck chairman, Asil Nadir, na im dey yarn dis one give di govnor on top di matter on Friday after di govnor talk am.

Di myth wey no concern Japan outside don, I tink sey na stroke na im dem take kill am, Mr. Nadir talk am.

But analysts say Sansui na one special case.

E expect to lose 6.4 billion yen for di year wey dey end tomorrow, and im liabilities now na about 13.8 billion yen. If you find sound, strong company for Japan, de no dey sell o, according to George Watanabe, one management consultancy for Tokyo based Asia Advisory Council.

Statistics on top foreigner matter differ, because unlike sansui wey dey Tokyo, and Osaka stock exchange, most of di company wey be Japan company wey be foreigner own, na only dem get am.

But all dis account wey be sey foreign company don buy small, small company wey be sey na Japan company don get many, many foreign company.

No be sey de dey expect Sansui to carry new wave of foreign buy.

If the yanga wey Japan get and di high price wey dem dey sell for Japan, no dey reach dem, dem go dey buy wetin Japan company dey sell with all dia friend, even though sey na Japan company dey buy pass, dem go still dey buy.

Usually when one Japanese company dey market now, e get few alternative, and di koko of sansui people wey dey inside one joint news conference here, e comot small doubt sey dis one no be di best time.

Before, Sanui first be one of Japan leader wey dey do high quality stereo equipment for audiophile.

But in recent years, di market don dey move towards smaller size like mini-comput, miniaturator, receiver, and software player wey fit dey on top of each oder.

Some of Sansui fellow audio-special company like Aiwa Co, and Pioneer Electric Corp, na dem carry dia own mini-computer, come push am enter deir own market, dey move am enter deir own business, plus deir laser disk, and deir portable cassette record.

Sanui late enter mini, and e no enter any oda business again.

As e dey increase in recent years, na so Sansui dey increase financial problem for different part of di world.

While competition, competition for offshore sake of di competition wey Japan go do, Sansui no get money to take build new plant for Southeast Asia, e say our company no fit cope with market condition well, well with di change wey dey for market.

But even Japan company wey be sey e be like dog fit con turn to good investment for foreign concern, some management people dey maintain am.

Yoshihisa Murasawa wey be management consultant for Booz Allen & Hamilton (Japan) insef yarn sey di company wey be sey de don dey sell for Japan company more, more of sey de don dey sell for foreign clients for future. Oga, Murasawa talk sey dis one wey be sey de don dey sell for Japan company more, more of sey de don dey negative, but de don dey positive o, sey some industry like pharmaceuticals, dey make sense.

Weda na pounded Peck own make sense still dey, but for inside di tori, Oga Nadir come bribe sey e go fit turn Sansui around.

Sanui, e say, perfect for di Polly Peck electronics operation wey dey do television, videocassette, microwave, and all di rest products on top original equipment, base on di name of oder company name.

E say Polly Pig go too expand sansui production line, e go use Sansui engineer to design di new product, and e go move Sansui make most of di most products, other than sophisticated audio equipment for inside Polly Peck own.

Any capital wey e (sanui) need to compete, become global entity wey fit compete with di best for di world, dem go inject dat capital.

And while Polly Peck no dey jettison di current top management structure of Sansui, e dey bring former Toshiba Corp, wey be executive vice president, and chief operating officer.

Dis one na everyday risk for di oga patapata for di oga patapata of pollute pikin, and di chairman of di party.

E use one small cloth wey dem dey call Polly Peck take build one big house wey don dey produce plenty money since 1980.

For September, e talk sey e go get di tropical fruit business of RJR Nabisco Inc. Del Monte food unit for #557 million ($878 million) ah.

Last month, polly Peck record 38% increase for di first half to #54.8 million from di 33.9 million wey dey make 63% increase for sales.
