Small business talk sey di latest one wey dey happen na dream come true, more affordable rate for employee health insurance, initially at least.

But de go wake up for nightmare.

Di reasonable first year rate dey follow by increase of 60% or more if big employee file dey complain, de go complain.

Insurance price for one small Maryland go reach 130% in less than two years, di last increase after one of di three people wey get am don get herniated disk.

E get one distinct possibility wey I fit lose my job on top dis one wey be sey employee, Karen Allen, of Floor Covering Resources, Kensington, Md, just tell congressional hearing.

She say her oga no fit afford di rate, and she dey fear sey she no go see anoda job again wit benefit plan to overtake her ailment.

For person wey dey work, and person wey dey work, de dey worry well, well.

Many times wey insurance dey show sey small business owners, dey rank di availability, and rising cost of health insurance, one of dem wey dey worry pass.

House Energy and Commerce Committee's health submittee wey dey headed by Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman of California dey look on top complain wey small businesses no fit maintain for demself weda dem file di claim, but many times dem no fit get coverage at all if doctor call di worker name uninsurable.

I get old fashion for people wey dey dat level, sick people wey need health insurance, Rep. Waxman talk sey wetin we dey see now na mockery of di idea of insurance, collect premium from healthy people, dump healthy sick people, pay deir own bill, some lawmakers don dey push law to reduce insurance policy.

Di worry dey increase because of increase wey insurers dey carry gowoo small business market.

For big company now wey be sey de dey buy im own hospital bill, insurance company don turn to small employer market wey be sey dey buy dem back water.

Insurance company go dey offer a good rate if no one sick, but na roll of dice na im dey roll for di Small Business Bureau one group wey be sey na 35,000 small businesses nationwide one case of cancer, or high risk pregnancy with sick infant, up to 60%.

Small business people dey pay insurance premium two to three times for one sickness.

Dem add join di group sey some of im member company don deny insurance because individual workers get contagious heart condition wey fit lead to psychological counselling after one divorce, hemorrhoids, and overweight.

Health Insurance Association of America, one join body wey dey sell insurance dey gree sey stiff competition from im member to insure businesses fit be sey na good risk for di first year wey dem take cover, na im make di problem for small business dey worse.

But e say rapid rate dey increase wit di higher cost of health care.

Some business people blame di problem on top strong competition for insurance market.

Dem say insurance company dey use policy aimed at least for bad risk because deir competitor dey do.

But wetin general dey do be sey, e go hard for small group to enter larger group, sotay e go dey risk for big base.

No be sey I dey accuse insurrect of duty, Robert Patricelli of di U.S. Chamber of Commerce tell Oga Waxman panel sey you fit no write on top social media wey go fit destroy am for market.

Rep. Waxman, and Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts don propose to do something about di problem.

Di proposal na just one of di legislation wey go allow businesses to provide health benefit, one thing wey dey very opposing small business wey be sey e go just compound di insurance cost.

But small business lobbyists dey yarn sey dem dey support di idea, dem add am di Kennedy Waxman bill, di new law wey dey give community rating, wey be sey government dey rate am with community, or oder big group, and dem dey plan to stop insurance company to take only low risk wey be sey dey sell market.

But number one for di list of priorities, na im National Federation of Independent Affairs talk sey na to stop state law wey dey bring special, special items like psychiatric care, basic health plan.

Dem dey argue, dey make am hard to provide basic, low cost hospital bill.

Before Wisconsin state put sey make dem do mental health care, na only 70 mental health clinic dey inside state, now na 400", Carolyn Miller wey be NFIB lobbyist, talk.

She dey talk sey dis kind thing don make insurance cost well well for Maryland and thirty for California.

Insurance company sef don strongly disagree with di plan wey di goment say doesn't save one dollar, na im James Dorsch, HIAA'S counsel, e just dey make healthy business cripple, and give employer less money to keep im workers healthy. Oga, Dorsch talk sey di HIAA dey come on top one kind plan to establish private insurance company wey no dey except certain employees.

Di complexities of di insurance palava dey make am hard to predict.

But for Ms. Allen, di employee wey im back leak come make insurance big, big insurance, di matter na simple, sey wetin good dey get for health insurance, she con tell am sey when e too cost, sey e go hard to keep after one big claim?
