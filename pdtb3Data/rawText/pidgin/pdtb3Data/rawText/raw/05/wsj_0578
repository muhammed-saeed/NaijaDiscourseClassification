If to say dis battle na movie, producers go dey drag for two script wey no get anytin escept one big scene wey dey common.

For di opener, Sony Corp, go gree to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc for one transaction wey close to $5 billion.

Shortly after dat one, Sony go buy Guber-Peters Entertainment Co, for $200 million and give di co chairmo, Peter Guber-Peter, and Jon Peters, di chance to run Columbia.

Mr. Peters go fly comot for New York o to tell Warner Communications Inc sey na Guber-Peter wan end im five years contract to produce only movie for Warner exclusive.

Na dere di two script go diverge.

For affidavits wey dey inside Los Angeles Superior Court on top di one billion breach of contract suit wey Sony carry against Sony sey na two people dem dey employ, Oga, Guber, and Oga Peter dey yarn one story.

Warner dey tell anoder one.

For inside di affidavits, Oga Peter talk sey im dey surprise when Oga Ross no gree for one meeting, con make am clear sey e go stop dem.

Oga Peters claim sey im dey remind Oga Ross sey Robert Daly, and Terry Semel wey be di top broder for Warner Brothers studio, don comot agriment sey we get right to accept one oda offer like Sony own.

In response, Oga Peters talk sey Oga Ross dey call im colleagues for Warner wit one obscension, come talk sey, “Tell dem sey dem no get work.

You fit carry am.

Warner deny Oga God Ross anytin wey e tok and in fact, e deny almost everytin wey be sey Oga God, Guber, and Oga God Peter yarn for inside dia aproko.

Tomorrow, Warner go bring out anoda batch of documents wey dey contend sey di essence of everytin wey dis guys dey yarn na lie, according to Warner chief outside counsel, Stuart Rabinowitz.

“Today, dem suppose set one judge wey go rule on-top Warner motion sey make dem block wetin dem dey koll Guber-Peters make dem dey go Columbia.

Di battery of legal documents wey bin dey inside di suit during di past week, give us insight into inside di work of dis Hollywood dogfight.

But dem go still make am klear sey, di first tin wey di judge go judge, na wen e bi sey anytin wey dey happen for dis world, na lie and na true.

Di matter fit never reach court court.

Warner talk sey wetin e really want na for di producers to do wetin dey contractual, but di bitterness of dis fight, and accusation wey dey fly for both sides, dey make am no dey possible sey di ten years relationship wey Warner and im two people get no go fit end.

Warner wey dey inside di merger wit Time Warner Inc, talk sey e don ready to settle di matter for court.

So far, however, Sony never ready to do big, big money wey dey owe am.

Mr. Guber, and Mr. Peters no too get trouble for di fight.

Son for e own part, e fit decide sey di money wey Warner take dey settle, or court fight, e dey too much, e go find person wey go run Columbia, even though sey na di money wey dem dey take guarantee Mr. Guber, and Mr. Peters, na im go cost too much.

Dat one wey be sey Oga, Guber, and Oga Peters no go suffer for financial side, but de go leave dem deir dream wey be sey de go run one studio, and deir relationship for Warner small, small.

Di centre of any court fight go dey different from di original contract wey Warner sign, but oder murki-... issues go play big role.

Tony and di Guber-Peters team dey hang plenty of deir case on top Warner wan release release last year from anoda contract and on top oral agreement wey de say allow dem to terminate deir current writing contract if e get chance to run one major studio.

Warner deny dat kind agreement and kworel for di Guber Peters version almost every telephone call and meeting wey di two sides do on top di matter.

Just as e bi with di two sides now, di way tins dey different from di one wey dey before.

Mr. Guber, and Mr. Peters talk for inside deir affidavit sey Warner don dey take step to freeze dem for deir project for Warner, especially sey Sylvester Stallone film, Tango and Cash.

Oga Peters talk for inside di affidavit sey dem tell di movie staff last week sey Warner dey take over di picture, and anoda producer go dey give all di order.

On top of im vexnashon, Oga Peters talk sey di film release date, by many months to December, and plan for one soundtrack wey worth millions of dollars drop.

Brother Hubert de la Bouillaire, one editor for di film, back Mr. Peters for inside one separate swear declaration.

Mr. De la Bouillaire talk sey Warner Bros production president, Mark Canton call am Oct. 19 and sey na Oga Peters dey comot for di picture.

If e call you up, just tell am everytin wey dey okay. Di new one wey dey inside di film, Bruce Baird, e don tell editor make e screen di picture no tell star Sirivil, Sirland, Kurt Russell, or Mr Peters sey di less we know, di less we know wey e dey easy for us.

If person talk, just lie, tell dem sey e go do, Mr. De lafaire talk sey Mr. Baird tell dem.

Dat, Warner's own na to say in total lie, di movie, e say e dey inside post-production stage of clean up di film, e say na Oga Peters and Oga Guber, as di contractual publishers wit consultation rights, dem don invite dem to screening, and to give dem input for di film.

Dozens of Guber-Peters staff, de still dey work on top Warner lot, and dey advise on top different projects on top daily basis, di lawyer dey yarn.

Mr. Guber, for im affidavit, na im talk sey when e advise Warner president, Terry Semel for di Sony show for lunch on Sept. 25, Mr. Semel come yarn sey we don finally see our long throat ambition to run and get equity for one major entertainment company.

Mr. Guber yarn sey im carry one release document, Warner don gree for 1988 when e, and Mr. Peter do abolous bid to buy some part of MGM/UA Entertainment Co, to run di MGM studio.

Oga, Guber talk sey e don cross comot mg wit one red paper wey e write for inside Kumbo, dey carry di document give Oga, Semel.

Sey absolutely noting to indicate sey Warner go get any objection for our assuming management position for Columbia, Oga Guber dey yarn.

Oga Semel for im affidavit, e no talk any hug, or congratulation.

E say im tell Oga, Guber, sey di deal, e no fit sign any document, and maybe di deal go good for am, and Mr. Peters, sey im go meet Oga, Rossi, and Warner Broder, Robert Daly, and sey for one conference call, di three gree sey dem no go fit free di Producers from deir contract.

Mr. Ross, for im own affidavit, na im and Oga Daly instruct Oga Semel sey make e tell di producers sey make dem no terminate dia agreement.

Oga guber yarn sey Oga Semel don carry dat informate, and sey Oga Semel yarn sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey Oga, sey

Oga guber also talk for im affidavit sey Oga, den talk sey even if Sony no wan, sey di relationship wey Warner get for us, no get where dem go put di egg together, sey e go sue Sony for plenty money.

Moreover, Oga Guber dey claim, Oga Semel tell am sey Oga Ross fit no object if na person oda dan Sony.

But Sony na wahala, di Guberp peter side don yarn sey na very, very big company wey be sey dey control big, big part for di U.S. entertainment business.

Some for Hollywood dey suggest Mr. Guber, and Mr. Peters take encouragement from Warner studio oga dem like, Mr. Semel, and Mr. Canton too o.

According to dis theory, Warner executive, wey dey hope to strengthen relationship wit di producers, e encourage Mr. Guber, and Mr. Peters for dem to set up one big entertainment company.

But di Warner executives for dia affidavit, deny ever sey dem dey ever tell di producers sey dem fit get out of dia write contract.

Oga Rabinowitz wey be Warner attorney, talk sey di studio still wan make di producers come back con do deir contract, sey dem be like mini studio, sey de get 50 project for development for Warner.

But Oga, Guber talk for im affida sey no be every project we go dey use.

For example, im talk sey since 1986, im, Oga Peter don develop pass 85 film project, and Warner don do pass 76 film, or e don choose say make e no produce at least 76.

For di project wey remain for Warner, Oga Guber dey yarn sey Oga, Oga, Oga, Oga, Oga, Oga, Oga, Oga, Oga God, Oga God, Oga God, Oga God, Oga God, Oga God, Oga God, Oga God, Oga God, Oga God, Oga God, Oga God, Oga God!
