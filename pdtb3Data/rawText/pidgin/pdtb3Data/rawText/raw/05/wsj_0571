Last week, Britain show anoda new immorality.

: Chancellor of di Exequer, Nigel Lawson resign because Prime Minister Thatcher no go fire her trusted adviser Sir Alan Walters.

Labour leader, Neil Kinnock wey dey lead British Labour Congress, come outside dey shout for Mrs. Thatcher because she dey independent and she no gree do wetin di men for her Cabinet dey talk.

British press dey make hill for molehill, dey cause unemployment, dey portray Mrs. Thatcher as one car wey cause economic policy to confuse people by driving a respected figure from government.

Di yeye posting wey dey do, na real quarrel.

Mr. Lawson and im colleagues for Europe wan make British pound join West Germany mark.

Sir Alan dey look dis one wey be sey e no get money, and e dey expensive.

As dere is attempt to anchor di dollar, wheder na gold, or oder currencies, di dispute is worth contemplating.

Until e resign, Mr. Lawson don dey do British monetary policy as if sey di money dey tied to di mark.

When Mrs. Datcher cut tax to 40%, Mr. Lawson flood di country wit money to stop di pound to dey against di mark.

And because of dat one, e con rule di money wey Mrs. Thatcher get, through a long, and costly effort, e con still lose.

With inflation increase, di pound begin fall against di mark.

To maintain di exchange rate wey de sell, Oga Lawson tight money policy, and bring intrest wey de dey sell go up to 15%.

Dis one wey be sey de dey double di mortgage rate wey be sey Mrs. Thatcher policy don cause plenty wahala, dey push labour make e enter deir front.

Instead of identifying im mistake as per British economic policy, and Mrs. Thatcher political fortune, Mr. Lawson push di pound to di mark as e dey enter European Monetary System wey dey regulate all member of di currency to Germany.

Dis one put Mrs. Thatcher inside one bind.

Di idea of European integration na one of di grand scheme wey dey appeal to intellectuals, media, and imagination, but na practical pitfalls.

If to sey dem put di money for di tax, British pipol for nor gri reduce am.

Di reason na simple.

Wen country reduce tax, e dey favour investors pass, e dey bring di money down.

Fear of bad EMS exchange of trade wey cause wahala for di Chirac government for France to kpakpakpa about how to reduce tax.

Edouard Balladur wey be Finance Minister dat time, dem sell am on top tax policy, but e dey worry sey government go dey call am anti-European because e dey disturb deir linked European currency relationship.

Di price of attract capital, weda na one own, or na foreigner own, na trade deficit.

To avoid dis deficit, Mr. Lawson add di money to prevent am make e no dey grow.

Dis misguided policy no fit stop British trade deficit.

So Mr. Lawson con saddle Mrs. Thatcher wit record of trade deficit, increase inflation, and high inflation rate, three political failure for one row.

Little do you know sey Mrs. Thatcher enemy too dey worry am to keep Mr. Lawson for office.

E dey extraordinary sey di British Treasury think sey e go fit stop trade matter by inflating di pound.

British balance on top tax matter show sey after dem reduce di tax to 40%, British capital reduce to 50 billion pounds (as e dey current) for 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986.

Dis change for di British capital account na to reopen business account, wey no go fit stop dem to dey tilt di currency.

Nicolas Lawson dey among di many confusion wey dey happen for Western Financial Council around 1980.

Most important government don forget how low tax rate take dey attract real capital investment, instead of to dey collect money from people wey dey show dem high interest.

Dis one don lead dem to a fruitless, and destructive policy circle.

First na money expansion to take reduce money wey be sey de say de dey reduce tax.

Den when currency fall, de go raise interest to attract financial flow to stabilize currency.

Dis policy na yeye policy and Sir Alan correct to point di yeye tins wey dey dere.

Britain and all Europe need to change wetin dey possible for European Union to join hand for di possible reunion, and neutralisation of Germany.

Germany wey remain for Western alliance go cause big wahala for Germany wey all oda members of Germany go join hand togeder to become oga for Germany.

Unless Soviet Union collapse, Germany reunification is likely to involve Germany's neutrality.

Di implications for Britain, France, and di rest of Europe, for having deir currency tied to di economic policy of a neutral country, we dey judge Mr. Lawson resignment to unfortunate circumstances.

At least, we must recognize di futility of trying to use exchange rate to compensate tax on top capital flows.

Mr. Roberts na assistant secretary under Presido Reagan.
