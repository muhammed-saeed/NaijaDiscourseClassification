John Lehman editorial page for Pentagon na one kind fake house wey dey disturb pipol for inside im house (for Pentagon, di Undead Walk), Oct. 18.

Di media dey treat Defence Department during di Vietnam War, di Carter administration denigration of military, and public scapegoat of Lt. Col. Oliver North all don serve to escult di poor souls wey dey dere.

Di result wey dey cause am be sey, people dey reward followers, no be sey dem wear di uniform, and e dey make people feel sey dem no get the mind to fit do wetin ghost dey do, i.e. to fit win anybody wey dem call on top.

Maybe di Halloween time na good time for Congress to dey look for funding for some kind ghostbusting equipment.

Like Greece

For example, e get one former air force officer wey im name na Christoph

New York

Where Oga Lehman dey jinger Gen. George Marshall dey mush for inside naval prerogation?

E don tay wey Alfred Thayer Mahan (U.S. Naval Officer and Naval historian) and Teddy Roosevelt di Navy sabi preach well, well for Washington State.

Oga Lehman even overlook sey navy get deir own air force, and deir own army (di one wey be sey de get deir own air force).

Di truth be sey dis katakata no be small, small, small tins wey be sey go happen for inside national security, but Oga Lehman be like sey na part of di problem, no be part of di answer.
