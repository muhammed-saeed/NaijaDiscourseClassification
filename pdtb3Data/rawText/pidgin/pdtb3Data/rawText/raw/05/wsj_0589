When Michael S. Perry take podium for one new cosmetics event, more dan 500 executives pack di room come out.

Mr. Perry wey dey do Unilever Group own, stop to scan di crowd, sey I dey see sey we get about half of di audience wey dey work for us, e con talk sey di oda half, we fit get long.

Members of di audience dey vex, dey laugh, deir industry just dey slow down small, small, small.

Unilver, AngloDutch, dotrich giant, na $2 billion e take buy land like Faberge, and Elizabeth Arden.

E dey hold di No. 3 position for U.S. department store.

Procter & Gamble Co, con gree sey dem go buy Noxell Corp for $1.3 billion.

Dat acquisition, wey go be completed by year end, na di Cover Girl, and Clarion makeup line, na im go be di top marketer of cosmetics for mass market.

E no too get di idea of buying, wey don affect cosmetics industry, as di companies wey dey do di acquiring, na im dey give dem big, big, big, big, big brands like soap, and toilet paper, sparking disdain for di glitzy cosmetics trade, but dem still dey bring mammoth marketing cymbalo, sparking fear.

Though e far from certain companies wey dey sell Promise margar, and Tide detergent go succeed for cosmetics, small doubt sey dem go shake di industry.

For now, both companies dey quiet about deir specific plans.

But industry people dey expect dem to blend methodical marketing strategy wey dem dey use for more mundane products wit more intuitive approach for cosmetics company.

Like increase in research, surge advertising budget, and aggressive pricing.

But some of dem wey be cosmetics, dem dey wonder wheder technique go dey inside bag we go dey do di cosmetics business.

Estee Lauder Inc., Revlon Inc., and oder cosmetic house wey traditionally be sey de don consider demsef as fashion company wey be sey deir product development dey guided by creative intuition.

Cosmetics company dey roll new makeup many times a year, and since most products fit dey easily copied by competitors, dem dey loath to test dem with consumers.

Just because, if cosmetics dey do, e dey do, e no mean sey na bag o, sey na carton o, sey na carton o, sey na inside small jar na im dey do am.

Unilever and P&G get other fine fine fine house wey fine well-well, but dem be: Unilever and P&G. Dem dey wear organization suit wey get fine shape.

Both companies na small money people wey be sey dey rely on big market research.

P&G, for example, e no dey too dey roll product for national level before e go dey sell well, well.

Both can be very aggressive pricing on products like soap, and diaper, to di extent wey some industry consultants dey predict cent-off price for mascara fit cause dem enter market.

P&G don already show sey e fit do some kind small, small, small, small, small, small, small, small, small, small, small, small, small, small, small.

For 1986, Richardson Vicks International come get one oil wey dem dey call Olaya.

Di creamer wey dem introduce for 1962, get image wey dem dey call ajebo. Di oil of Olay carry di baggage of dey use am, basically na old women wey dey use am, na im David Williams, wey be consultant for New England Consulting Group.

P&G set out to reposition di label to include facial cleans, and moisturers for sensitive skin.

Di oil wey dem dey sell for Olayin still dey der too. Dem use gold take dey stamp di box wey dem dey sell put.

Also, P&G con shift deir campaign from one waning old women to one one wey dey feature woman for her mid-30s, dey promise sey no be sey e go grow old, sey sales don increase.

Goliat like Unilever and P&G get plenty advantage pass small rivals own.

Next year, Noxell plan to roll perfume wey im dey call Navy, na im be di chairman of Noxell.

Without P&G backing, Noxell for fit spend di estimated $5 million to seven million to do dat one without sey e go knock on top di main name wey e get.

Pack company wey be sey de go make am hard for small people to continue to dey competitive, Oga Buntin talk.

Further consolidation for di industry, e fit follow.

Rumors sey Una dey interested to get Schering-Plough Corp. Maybelline unit don dey plenty well, well.

Unilever no go comment, Schering, denies di brand dey for sale.

E fit be sey Unilever and P&G dey there to spread advert wey fit cause problem for body.

While di two of dem na di biggest advertisers for di world, most of dem wey dey do cosmetics, dem no dey too put eye for national advert.

Instead, de dey focus on events for department store, and dey pour out promotional budget into gifts wey go along with buy.

For example, Este Lauder dey only get estimated 5% sales for advertising for U.S., and Oga Lauder talk sey im no get plan to change im strategy.

Di biggest dramatic change wey go happen now, may be for new product development.

Nearly 70% of dis cosmetics dey come through mass distribution outlets like drug store, and supermarket, according to Andrew Shore wey be one analyst for Shearson Lehmann Hutton Inc.

Dat figure don dey inching for many years.

As di trend still dey, una go dey buy mass market, but na only mid price, especially di one wey be sey de wan increase.

For dis fall, for example, L'Oreal Group, ordinarily high end line, dem roll out one sell for market wey dem dey call Plenitude, wey be sey de dey sell five to $15.

Consumers fit try to fill dat gap wit new product.

Di one wey be Nigerian cosmetics, wey be Unilever and P&G get big research centre, wey be sey dem dey buy new one.

In fact, P&G show sey e dey enter market leadership when e dey introduce product wey get technical edge for di competition.

For example, after P&G introduce one version wey get bleach wey dey safe for all colour and material.

Dat one don lead industry people to dey speculate sey tomorrow product development, na im go dey push pass for fashion whims, especially for di mass market side, especially for di U.S.A.S.Loyal, you go see fewer gimmick.

But dis one wey una dey so, wetin una go gain for Una life, wetin una go gain for una life, go far pass wetin di big-big company dem wey don try get am, fit gain.

In di 1970 na different pharmaceutical company like Colgate Palmolive Co, Eli Lilly & Co, Pfizer Inc. and Schering-Plough don do many cosmetics.

Industry consultant say na only Schering-Ply wey be sey na im dey make mass market maybelline maintain better business.

Colgate wey buy Helena Rubenstein for 1973 sell di brand seven years after di label expire.

Unilever don already suffer some kind disappointment.

Di mass market wey dem buy for 1987 join Chesebrough-Pond Inc, don lose share according to industry analyst.

E fit be sey di rish world of departmental store, where dem dey sell cosmetics, wey Unilever dey concentrate on top, na im dey make am even more potopoto.

For dis niche, makeup, na im dey change season because sey na im dey join dress.

Because brand loyalty weak, and most cosmetics, na unplanned, unplanned training of store staff by cosmetics company.

And to get one luxury image wey be sey e go fit persuade consumers to pay more dan $15 for lipstick, or eye makeup, na small, small touch wey be sey di company never start to dey do deir own.
