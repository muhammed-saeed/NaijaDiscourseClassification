In di aftermath of di Beijing massacre on June four, economists advanced on top how Hong Kong go be.

Among the people wey help pass na BT Brokerage (Asia) Ltd.

Inside one June 5 reaction, Bankers Trust Co, unit declare di economy shock.

Others get sense pass us.

For one July analysis wey dem dey call from Euphoria to Despair, W.I. Carr, Far East, Ltd., anoda securities firm yarn sey eroding confidence fit undermine future economic development.

na so too Hong Kong dey shake and e dey kause wahala for di economy too.

Many people don survive di gbege wey dey happen for China.

Signs of revival e be like sey dey Hong Kong hardhit hotel sector.

But for stock, and real estate market, activity still dey despite sey de lost much of wetin de lose.

Doz wey dey sell, doz wey dey sell, and even fancy restaurants, dey increase community wey dey tight im belt.

As many people wey dey do business dey see am, people wey dey do business dey see am, e be like sey na one kind wahala be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be di economy from o.

Dat paradox na Hong Kong economic gain o, but politically e go affect China.

Hong Kong prospect be like model for capitalist efficiency on top South China doorstep.

China land and labour na di only option wey dey cheap for local industry.

China heavy breeze dey pass di territory port.

For di ten years wey di communist nation don dey comot from isolation, di business wey dem dey do for West Africa don increase evriwhere for Hong Kong as regional business centre.

E be like sey dis benefit na despite sey China dey now economic, and political wahala.

But for Hong Kong, China no be only business.

Di na also di govnor power wey come 1997, na im go take over dis British colony.

China leader don promise to release post-1997 Hong Kong.

Dat promise don skata now, dat same leaders don fall back on top Marxist dogma, and brute force to crush deir democracy.

Plenty people and capital from Hong Kong don dey increase since di way government dey rule since di 1980 ’ s.

People wey dey do this kind thing before, na im dey make people believe sey, na im dey give am better economy, Hong Kong go fit get enough money, and talent to take manage imself.

Since June 4 wey we don dey see immigration matter and investment matter for other country, e be like sey nothing dey happen again.

Investment and immigrant plan dey take time before dem go fit produce fruit.

Dat na di only four months wey don pass since di Beijing massacre, and some dey prepare to dey predict how e go take happen.

Di only consensus na sey more money, and people dey go Hong Kong pass wetin de bin tink.

Dis expected blow don cause palava for economy.

Di question wey many people dey see, na how long dis kind wahala go last?

Maureen Fraser wey be one economist for W.I. Carr, wey be subsidiary of France's Banque Indosuez, na im dey yarn sey di territory fit no get power again until sometime after 1997.

E fit get up, or two in between.

But with local investors dem wey dey shake for China political matter, and economic situation, she talk sey genuine recovery no go start until Hong Kong go show sey e dey safe under Chinese sovereignty.

Investors get to accept massive slowdown for di run up to 1997, she say over di next few years, I go advise.

For one new book wey dey ground, one political economist wey im name na Miron Mushka don do three future scenario from interview wit 41 government savants, and business people.

Nearly half of dem dey argue sey Hong Kong no dey easy relationship with China, but no be sey e go restrict long-term economic growth.

The rest people wey dey think sey Hong Kong go dey again and people wey dey think sey wahala no go dey again.

Interviews happen two years ago.

Since di China crisis come out, Oga Mushka talk sey di situation wey dey middle of di road group, na im make dem do one kind big, big reassurance on top di wahala wey Hong Kong dey face now.

Di consensus of dis group wey e dey do wey e dey call realist, na sey local economy go dey grow for di 1990 e go dey average between 3% and 5%.

Hong Kong go strong well-well if e dey grow well, even if e dey small.

Dat since di 1960 na double digit of domestic product growth under 5% for two to three to three years.

Di first one wey happen for 1967 68, when China Cultural Revolution bring bloody street riot for di country.

Di oder one na for 1974-75 after join body shock on top world recession, and serious local stock market crash.

For 10 years now, Hong Kong economic growth don average reach 8.3% per year.

Given Hong Kong record, Oga Mushka say true, true, true, true, true, true for inside di interview wey e do two years ago.

For di current condition, e talk sey deir situation no get as e be now.

Di city fit lose some of im ogaoga patapata.

Oga Mushka, wey be di director of di Baring Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd, one unit of Britain Barings PLC, say e no go need to suffer for disaster.

E just mean sey Hong Kong go just make sense pass.

Di official forecast of GDP wey be sey colony dey produce goods, and service, plus foreign income, Mr. Mushka show sey e dey near di mark.

After government don account of di fall of China crisis, e be like sey na 1989 GDP increase by 5%.

Update wey dey inside Awake! (Awake!) wey dey inside Awake! (Awake!) wey dey inside Awake!

Sir Piers Jacobs, Hong Kong financial secretary, na im dey reason further downward na im dey justify unless di economy stage more convincing, we no dey look anyhow wey be sey na doomsday scenario o, e say clearly we dey enter difficult period.

Many factors apart from bad economic of 1997 go affect how Hong Kong economy be.

One concern for Japanese investors.

For Hong Kong property issue for 1985, by last year Japan don dey top foreign investor with $ 602 million.

Di market don quiet well, well since di China crisis.

But if Japan return, deir financial fit compensate some extent for local investors wana commitment.

Anoder one, and critical factor, na U.S., Hong Kong biggest export market.

Even before di China crisis, weak U.S. immigration dey slow local economic growth.

No be sey, strong money wey people dey spend for U.S. two years now don help local economy grow well, well pass as e dey now.

True, true, some economists dey maintain sey global force go continue to dey regulate how Hong Kong dey do.

Once deir weather, like U.S. demand, dey swing for territory, de go argue, local business people go likely overcome deir 1997 wahala, and continue to dey do business as usual.

But economic argument, however solid, e no go impress Hong Kong 5.7 million people.

Many of dem na refugee, after dem don run comot from China after political repression, and poverty since when Communist Party enter power for 1949.

Because of dis one wey dey happen so, many of dem wey dey plan to go Hong Kong now, de no fit talk sey de don dey improve for di political, economic, and economic situation for di country.

Immigration matter jump start for 1985 when Britain and China take measure wetin dey happen for Hong Kong future.

For 1987, Hong Kong make am di most prosperous year a decade o, 30,000 people still remain, 58% from di previous year.

Last year, na 45,000 go.

Government dey predict sey di annual outflowing of di economy go increase well, well for di next few years, at di same rate wey 60,000 people dey see, sey e go dey very, very low.

Many of di people wey dey leave, na managers, and professionals.

While one profet no go know di exact cost of dat “brain drain ” to di economy, nobody go doubt sey e dey bring threat.

When economy lose big part of im work force wey be sey e dey also happen to include most productive member, economic growth don dey bound to suffer. Anthong Wong wey be economist for Hang Seng Bank talk.
