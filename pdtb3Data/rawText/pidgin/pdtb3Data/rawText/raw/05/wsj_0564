:.START

Swisserland'S most popular raider now say im no be one.

Werner K. Rey believe sey na friendship dey make person make fortune.

E nor go tey before yu go start to dey do good tins for each oda. E nor go tey before yu go start to dey do di wiked tins wey yu dey do and yu go still dey use di yuzles tins wey yu dey do. Oga God, wey bi 46 years, don grow from betta bank kon rish billionaire.

He achieve dis one na for inside jewelled talent wey e take dey waka for di door of established European companies.

Latest one wey dey happen for September na im oga talk about di five billion naira (money wey reach three billion naira) merger between Abidia S.A., di world second largest temporary employment agency, and Inspectorate International S.A., one big company wey dem dey call Rey-controlled Product Index.

Shareholders must approve di merger for general meeting of di two companies for November.

But almost certain since Oga God, Rey and a friendly Adia management dey dere.

After di transaction, Mr. Rey talk sey di total value of im 20% stake for di new company, na im Omni Holding AG go hold around 1 billion Swiss francc.

Dis one go be im return on top of di original investment of between 50 million Swiss francs and 80 million Swiss francs.

Mr. Rey buy one small stake wey dem dey call Inspectorate for 18 million Swiss francc for 1982, wey be small company wey dem dey call European and U.S. take over.

I like succeed says Oga Rey for one recent morning of work for home wey im too dey like.

E get one house wey get green meadow wey open for where dem dey call Lake Geneva. The house no far from where water dey and e dey show face French Alps.

For the corner where e dey stay, e get one fine desk wey dem make with tray.

E get one small Renoir for wall.

Zuriki-Based magazine Bilanz wey get about 1.5 billion Swiss francc, talk dis one.

One man wey im name na Bilanz write sey : â€˜ Nobody for Switzerland ever travel go there quick quick. Na im be the first person for this country to see sey better thing just dey lie for ground dey wait mey dem fit karry am up.

In short, find company wey dey weak, but rich asset.

But wen Swiss financial press, and many analysts don dey para on top of Mr. Rey and im unwise way wey e take dey do, e no easy at all.

For Switzerland most prestigious newspaper, Neu Zuercher newspaper, Oga Rey, e be like sey e don ready to remain di form of baller, one image wey don prove to be eazy to overcome.

For 1976 wey be di first time for Switzerland establishment, Oga Rehoboam lay foundation for im present day prominence wit one unheard raid on top Bally wey be di country shoemaker.

Sitting beside one banker for London, where e dey work as financial consultant, e come hear sey one big chunk of bally share dey sell.

When e look Bally, e no fit believe wetin e see, one big company wey dey hold big European cities and one market capital of 28 million Swiss francs (wey get 7,000 workers).

E invest four million frankinc, and two million frankinc from im papa, and im wife, Oga, dey collect 20% of bally own.

But dat kind style na im come enter Switzerland for 1976 o, and e still dey common for di limited restriction wey dey allow make company dey do.

To di extend, Oga Rey go sell im ball to di weapon maker Oerlikon-Buehrle Holding AG as e take dey push di establishment make e enter inside di Swiss old boys network.

Oga Rey make 50 million Swiss franc on top di sale, say Blair no be unfriendly takeover, e insist.

Buy from willing shareholders dey impossible Oga Rey wey be sey I buy from willing shareholders.

But Oga Rey don dey careful well, well since den to see sey de welcome im move.

And e don work to shed im own image.

For 1979, im work as electrician start to dey collect Swiss metal wey dem dey call Selve, wey dey for Thun.

For Switzerland, strong foreign competition and high domestic cost, dis one be like yeye tin.

But Mr. Rey con do merger for di next few years between di country big producers, di increased efficiency don cripple di industry.

After three years, machine wey dem dey call Architects, Architects, Architects, Vevey S.A. Dem go come be part of Rey empire.

Once again di company future be less naira.

But after dem con dey restructuring under new management, di profit come dey roll inside.

A huge boost for Oga Rey to di Swiss come for 1986 when e sell 60% of im Phibro bank give di conservative Swiss cantonal bank.

Dem name am Swiss Cantobank, and dey use am dey expand abroad.

For 1987, Oga Rey bested wey be the main publisher house to take over Swiss Jean Frey AG, one major publisher of magazines and newspapers.

And with di new acquisition of 30% of Wintertur, Gebrueder Sulzer AG, Oga Rey don enjoy di status of White Knight.

Sulzer prefer am to financier Tito Tettamanti, wey e secretly carry di company company stock cause bitter fight.

Meanwhile, as e be sey de don mount so, so eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh e

Today, dis Oga Rey empire dey under di name Omnicorp offering service, e dey handle merger, acquisition, acquisition, securities, and real estate matter.

For di list of di companies wey dey for United Kingdom-based airplan, Checkrobot Inc, one U.S. company wey dey do business wey dem dey sell, Norment Industries, one U.S. company wey dey sell securities, Com Systems Inc, one U.S. regional telephone company, and major big-big companies for U.S. and Europe, dey dere.

For financial analysts, reading Omni account na tough tin, Companies move in and out na im Helga Kern of KK Swiss Investment talk.

Financial analysts talk sey Oga, Rey dey attracted to companies wey dey valued on top dia real state matter.

For August, Omni buy 80% stake for Harpener AG wey dey West Germany, one land wey fine well well.

Di internal transaction inside di Rey empire be sey na only small shareholders dem get, but analysts say e make sense sey di main business na to dey do product inspection, and temporary help.

Mr. Rey talk sey di move na still one oda example of im own conservatism.

E dey explain sey company with real estate dey give security, real estate dey fit use am, e dey point out, dey guarantee for corporate development.

E say e wan influence, but no be manage company I wan be like inancier, Alan Bond, and di oder Australians.

I no wan make company build around me.

I wan make only dem stand.
