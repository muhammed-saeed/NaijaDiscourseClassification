One of di tings wey I learn for World Series dis past few weeks, na sey di Richter scale wey dey measure earthquake no be like di one wey dey your bathroom.

Aquake wey dey measure two on top of di Richter no dey serious reach one level because 10 times pass.

A three na 10 times 10 again and so on.

Sey na wetin dey October 17 be dat o.

Think am sey I go buy one of dose “I Survived” T-... after all.

From wetin dey dia hand, na San Pablo do di show wen e show sey Oakland Athletics do Friday, and Saturday night na im come scata di ball long short series wey dem dey call Longest Short Series between 10 to 11.

Di boys wey dey carry white elephant for chest no fit move di eart well, but dem do some kind big tings wit ball.

Pale Pachyms carry six of em out of di community wey dey inside Candlestick Park for di two match wey dem play go reach 13-7 and 9-6 win for San Francisco Giants.

Dem win two times, one win for Oct. 14 and 15 (di result na 5-0 and 5+1), dat one con make dem win di seven series.

Di joke here na sey Giants lose by mistake.

Dat one na trut, but sha o, na mistake.

Dem show, but no gree, no gree challenge.

De led for nary aninning for di four games, and de manage de fans only one time.

Dat one happen for di seventinin wen dem lose 8-2 wen dem lose 8-2. Dem bring dia big hot, big heat wey be Will Clark, Kevin Mitchell wit one out of evry six wey dey run on top di plate.

But Clark lie down for one small field wey dem dey call spina bifida and na Rickey Henderson dey ride am. Na 62,000 sakrifice dey inside di kloud.

I go out to Todd Burns, di A'Burns, and tell am sey we no go allow dis guy blow we, na Oakland catcher Terry Steinbach of di decisive confrontation with Mitchell wey be di National League king ah, I tell am make Mitchell reach everytin, and na wetin we do be dat.

Di ball wey e hit no be strike.

If to say na, e for hit am.

But if A'A no win in four, de for win in five, or six, or seven.

Na di best team win dis series wey we don see pass ehn.

Baseball ain't ball wey di good team knack for bad one.

Best baseball team win six of 10, while worst win four of 10.

Without to dey vex, allow me suggest sey some new champion for dis world, according to us (as e dey U.S.), de for no rank No. 1 for many poll.

Dat list wey dey inside dis list na di last season champs, Los Angeles Dodgers wey do miracle house run by Kirk Gibson and two faultless pitching wey Orel Hershiser do na im give one five minute victory for one Oakland crew.

But dis A'A con still get small grade low for di 1989 report card.

Dem lead Major Leagues for yearly win with 99 and flattened Toronto Blue Jays four game to one for American League pennant before dem lose dia cross rivals.

Di thief testimony to show sey dem go do di tournament na from Giants manager, Roger Craig afta im team lose for di five home side wey dem tie afta di 61 years old show.

Sey a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... on top of di fence o.

Di A'A portion wey dey show for di series get A, as in big.

Dem get 85 foundashon and dia nine home dey inside one set.

Eight Oakland players jam housers wit centerfielder Dave Henderson wit two k gbege both Friday.

Ritkey Henderson wey be di do all over man get nine hit, set, or four game series mark for three three two, e steal base three three.

Di sole, no be to dey house na to dey clean hitter Mark McGwire na im dey lead dem evriday wit 33, plus five hits on top one ball wey dey play for ground three wey stop Giant rally while di matter still dey ground dey ground. Think am sey I go redo my image o, get dis one for hand na nika o, nika o, nika o, nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nik

Even wit dat power show, di Oakland Star wey be di Most Valuable Player award, na person wey be pitcher, Dave Stewart.

E shut di Giants on top five hits for Game One, allow three hits for di five hits inside seven minutes Friday afta di 12 days break wey di earthquake cause.

Stewart honor na correct one on top two grounds.

One be sey despite im 62 regular season wen e don dey win three seasons for di Land Beyond the Late News, im mate don dey deceive am and e dey miss any prize wey e suppose get.

Di oder one na Oakland native and e last week wen e go quake-hit area.

A'A con toasted deir victory wit beer (de con displeased with traditional champagne showers indeba on top of di quake victims), Stewart con talk sey im team ring go bring out im own trophy o, sey give me four, five more series wit dis people, and I no dey worry sey I go win Cy Cy Cy Cy Cy, e say dey talk to di best pesin award.

Ehn people change, a'A ring cycle, a'A dynasty, na di major topic of post-play today sotay Sandy Alderson wey be di team general manager for di team, na im come tear im shirt say people change, team change, e come warn say e go easy for everybody to get worse result for dis game.

E fit don add one interesting fact wey dey di history book: di last series wey Cincinnati Reds do come for 1976, wey be di first year wey ball player dey free agency.

Dem don talk am before sey free agency go allow big, big market team to owe better talent, but di opposite one don happen be sey, twelve different clubs don win title for di 14 season since when e start.

Di number na wi o, wi o, wi o, wi o, wi o, wi o, wi o, wi o, wi o, wi o, wi o, wi o, wi o, wi o!
