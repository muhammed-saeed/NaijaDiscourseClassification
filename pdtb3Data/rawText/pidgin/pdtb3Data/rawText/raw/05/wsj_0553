Wi dey sorry to see Nigel Lawson don comot for di British government.

He is a politician wey get di courage to conviction, as in summarise sacking, and especially on top of income tax to 40%.

But at di end of im resignation as Chancellor of di Exequer, e fit be good ting o, especially if e work out o sey e want force Prime Minister Thatcher, and her fellow workers to chook eye on top di matter of genuine intellectual matter.

Early women, na true sey de dey talk so o!

Di Fleet Street reaction wey dey inside di Guardian tori na, â€œDepart Reveals Thatcher Poison, British politicians divide into two groups of chicken, di one wey dey kut neck, and di one wey dey shout sky dey fall.

So far as we see sey na only two people dey do wit dignity, sey di matter serious, serious, serious matter na im be sey na Mr. Lawson, and Sir Alan Walters, na im be di counter of di Chancellor problem wey also resign as personal adviser to Mrs. Thatcher.

Di problem be sey on top di vital issue of financial policy, and exchange rate, conservative, free market economists divide into at least three incompatible camps.

Dem dey call di strict monetary wey dey believe sey floating exchange dey free economy wey dey stabilize di monetary okay balance.

E get some business men for di world wey dey sell global currency, dey try to spread am with di normal exchange rate.

Doz wey dey sell and sell give oda pipol, dey der too. Dem dey predict and tok with difren-difren language, so dat dem go fit balance trade.

Dis one na wahala not only for Prime Minister Dacher, but for Presido Bush ah as e dey show for di ongoing exchange of money between Federal Reserve, and Mulford Treasury.

For Britain own, Oga Lawson, na im be di closest ting for London to a supply side for di world.

E no only slamit small tax, e first spark fresh growth for Britain, but e wan regulate money policy wit targeted exchange rate, even wit di European Monetary System.

No be sey I gree with wetin Oga God Lawson tok about any oda tin wey be sey, Sir Alan na klot wey get dye to take dey pay tax wey fit kill pesin.

To confuse di level, dat before U.S. experience, na im make am clear sey dis one wey be sey de kollect money from Britain international account, and di money wey sterling dey pay.

Dem add di money wey be sey dem go pay back, come make Britain get one better place to invest, come make plenty money dey come out.

Accounting definition, na im cause sudden trade deficit.

As in U.S., e still produce sudden surge for di demand for sterling, wey be sey de don dey get di same amount wey dey di sterling scale ah.

At dat point, di options na: raise di money wey dey aggregate, as Sir Alan just advise, and forget di money wey dey surge.

To push di pound even lower to try cure trade deficit, one policy for Britain don show many, many times.

Or to supply enough money to meet di increased demand, and stabilize di exchange rate, as di Chancellor argue, and make sure sey dis policy dey permanent by joining EMS.

Na so Paul Volcker take cause di same wahala wey e cause na im make am sell di dollar soar (though di money wey dem dey sell na di same money wey dem dey sell give egg on dia own wey dey fall).

But dis one scatter U.S. manufacturing sector kpatakpata.

Oga Lawson, though no allow am join EMS, e choose to shadow na Germany mark.

E do increase of inflation along with rapid growth, na wetin Sir Alan talk for Prime Minister mind be dat.

But in recent times, di pound don dey fall wit high inflation rate too wey be sey even di highest interest rate, Mr. Lawson don come outside dey stop am.

So wetin happen for Britain fit surprise person well well wey far pass where dem dey call Albion.

We don dey follow di matter before Oga, Lawson resign, and we don offer some of di collection for im successor, and one Deputy, John Major.

To start with, make we see sey in contrast with di U.S. deficit, Britain don dey run small, small budget.

Afta dis one, Keynesian tishas and twin deaf masters, no nid to apply.

Sey meh we still add Oga, Lawson own explanation as we take understand am.

Unlike U.S., Britain no ever lose any money at all.

Di money wey OECD dey confirm, e dey very high for Britain, im economy dey push against inflation.

E dey easy for person to flash, and e dey hard for person to fit control im temper.

Mey we still concede sey for Britain, di monetician cause some kind kain credibility wey lost for di U.S. experience.

One man wey im name na Nicholas, wey im name na Paul Craig Roberts, wey dey do business with people wey dey sell things give people wey no dey serve Jehovah.

E fit be sey di fiscal shock wey dey come from inside, na di best wey dey come from inside, na im Mr. Lawson resign on top weda na weak pound, no be strong person.

We remember sey Oga Roberts no only hala di Chancellor dey too easy because of sey e wan give sterling, but e still lead di chorus say Oga Volcker no too tight when e give di dollar rise.

Anywhere wey yu go, make yu use gold take measure am. E fit bi sey na M-Meal dey measure am, but e fit bi sey na money dey buy am.

Globalists dey like to tink sey Oga Lawson run onto technical reef.

For katakata, to choose among una first pariwo go dey important, maybe na di wrong pounding rate e choose.

Because dat matter, maybe e fix di wrong currency.

We dey sympatise wit Mrs. Thatcher dey reluctance to tie her currency to one kobo wey be di domestic political imperative for West Germany.

E fit be sey dis one go don small well, well if to say dem fix am on top low tax, dey regulate, supply, and low inflation.

Alan Reynolds of Polyconomics add im suspicion sey di unrecognized inflationary culprit na budget surplus.

People wey be sey de fit shake Keynesian ghost for head, go know sey di money wey dem dey pay now, na im be sey na expansion of open market operation, e be sey na extension of money supply.

Oga Reynolds also note sey since British bank no dey reserve reserve, high inflation rate dey reduce dan to cause recession.

We go add say for political terms, Mrs. Thatcher problem no dey settle between di Chancellor and her adviser.

At di end, no policy follow wetin we dey follow and instead of wetin we go dey do wetin we go dey do wetin we go dey do.

In particular, shadowing, na anyting wey dey fixed, na open yarn sey di exchange rate target no dey credible.

All di more so, when strong voice come dey para on top di policy.

Better meh we get true monetari policy just for di experience.

So Oga Lawson had to resign.

At di end of im move, na response from Sir Alan's autobiography for di American Economic and ten thousand circulation journal.

But na di ting wey dey cause di ting con dey o.

Dis na wetin Oga, Major, and Mrs. Thatcher go do now, na im de go remain.

Dem face stubborn inflation, stagflation wey be sey na stagflation.

Una no fit solve dis one wey be sey na another wahala una go still dey face. Una no fit reduce wetin una get to buy tins, una no fit reduce am.

Our advice na to immediately return government surplus to di economy through incentive - increased tax, and find out some monetary policy policy target wey dey balance supply, and demand for money (wey no be JAMB or INEC).

Dis na di one wey dey supply side economics wey dem do for America and around 1980 to solve serious problem wey dey serious pass di one wey dey Britain today.
