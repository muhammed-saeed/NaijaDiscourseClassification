We no tink sleeping bel mentality go ready to take on di level.

But Kenneth Leon, wey be telecoms analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co, come find out sey BellSouth proposal still dey fail because sey di company no go need to wait for five years before dem go start to dey buy more LIN, sey how many share go dey around for 1995? E say nothing dey wey go stop BellSouth to dey buy up till di meanwhile.

BellSouth's revised proposal surprise many industry people, especially because di company don ready to accept some kind future earnings.

William O. McCoy, president of di company BellSouth Enterprises Inc, na im yarn sey di revised agriment with LIN would dilute bell south earnings by about 9% in between 1990, 1991 and by very little thereafter.

True, BellSouth cellular operation na di first for di country wey go dey profitable.

For national over trade matter, LIN talk sey di amount wey dem get na $4.625 to close for $112.625, while McCaw fall for $37.75.

Di proposed BellSouthLIN cellular company, plus di newly acquired Metromedia stake, go give di new entity 55 million potential customers plus about 35 million for di nation top 10 market.

Mr. Leon of Bear Stears yarn sey as McCaw attempt to buy time, e fit carry antitrust suit against BellSouth with di Justice Department and U.S. District Judge, Harold Greene wey be sey na im dey enforce di law wey break di Bell system for 1984.

The truth be sey, e be like sey McCaw use one short statement take talk am.

Urning LIN directors to conduct one fine auction on a level wey dey play field, McCaw ask how much public interest dem go do wit di Bell operating company wey dey control over 94% of all cellular potential customers for di nation top 10 market.
