There may be truce in di long war of nerves between di US Congress and di Oyinbo government on top how dis country dey conduct secret intelligence operation for abroad.

After years of mistrust wey born of Watergate, past mismanagement of di Central Intelivision Agency, and di Iranian Contra sele, President Bush, and Senate Intelivision Committee, dem don ready now, at least to trust each oda when e come to set policy on top of activity.

If dat attitude still dey, e fit make dem for cover action small, small, small gist wey no dey show for many years.

On top of di week wey don pass now, di Presido don gree to keep di committee, usually in advance, of cover action, and put key intelligence write.

Dat one no be di way wey Reagan administration take handle all dose kind matter.

Oga Bush don promise to respect di 14 years old executive order wey dem dey call Barrister U.S. agent from Assassination of foreign leaders, or dey help oder people to do am.

Goment never fully rely on former CIA chief, William Casey and National Security Adviser, John Poindexer to honor di ban.

Despite di CIA objection, Oga Bush too don gree to establish inspector general for di CIA wey go be independent of di CIA director.

In return, Senate panel don drop effort to enact legislation wey be sey na di administration go inform dem within 48 hours before dem enta any cover activity.

Di EC don also remove ban on top CIA use of contingency fund for covert act, and e don gree to release some kind torture, and legal sanctions on top coup plan to ensure sey CIA no come back to Assassination.

We don finally convince dem sey Casey, and Oliver North no dey work again for here na im one administration sama.

Di new understanding no just come out in a spontaneous sweetness, and light.

Di waka come afta one kind of majik wey dem dey do for inside politics wey follow dis month failed coup attempt for Panama.

Oyinbo Oyinbo, wey be Oyibo, wey be Oyibo, wey be Oyibo, wey be Oyibo, wey be Oyibo, wey be Oyibo, wey be Oyibo, wey be Oyibo, wey be Oyibo, wey be Oyibo, wey be Oyibo, wey be Oyibo.

Oga Bush even yarn for imsef sey one, one olden days deal with Congress, sey im go tell di oda oda Panamanian dictator, Manuel Noriega if U.S. come hear of one coup plot wey fit endnger im life.

Di Presido also yab him say e fit vex for dis year intelligence bill if e dey too restrictive.

For inside di Informate Commitee Chairman, David Boren, and Vice Chairman, William Cohen (R., Maine) for dia side, dem come outside dey drop classified document, dey leak am, dey try to shift di blame to Congress on top of di bunguable attempt to topple Gen. Noriega.

Oyinbo waka o, e waka o, e waka o, e waka o, e waka no o, e waka go di kind constitutional confrontation wey conservative party, wey no wan any of dem to dey control intelligence matter.

Instead, na Oga, Bush, and im aides make am clear sey dem dey under Congress hand, dey feel sey dem fit work with am wey be sey na small, small o. Boren, and moderate Mr. Cohen take dey iron deir kworel.

Senator dey respond well, well.

Sey Boren happily tell tori people sey de don do meeting of di minds wit di Oyinbo, and di committee don give Mr. Bush clean slate, free of di impediment wey dey inside di Reagan years.

Sen. Cohen talk sey di relationship don change to di old one.

â€œE still get some tins wey una go soon do.

Mr. Bush na reserving di right in rare cases to keep Congress in di dark, asserting constitutional prerogative di committee no gree.

And pending judgement department interpretation of di Assassination ban fit raise question wey be sey de wan settle.

Also, both sides fit face political critics.

Some wey be conservative go dey accuse di Presido too much.

And dem continue to attack CIA Director, William Webster because dey too accommodating to di committee.

At di same time, some of dem wey be sey de go carry out sey de dey accuse Sens.

Borno, and Cohen of wetin dey comot, and dem go dey warn sey lawmakers concession dey bring more ogbonge gbege like sey na dem be di mining of Nicaraguan harbor, and Iran arms market.

But if di cooperative attitude, and more consultation for top of di matter, di country fit enter one kind era wey be sey de go scrapp di quota, but risk dey for sey dem go do some kind big, big tins wey be sey de go do widin.
