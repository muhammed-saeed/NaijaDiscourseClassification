If person wey be TV weatherman go jam butterfly again after one question wey dey ground, Donald H. Straszheim go just dey understand.

Di oga wey be sey na Merrill Lynch & Co. E dey find imsef for di Midwest on top im first road trip since when e go back on top one major prediction.

Oga Straszheim now, e go take small heat, and e dey right.

Since di last time wey e travel like dis many months now, e don do boldly forecast of recession.

For February 1988, for example Merrill Lynch's weekly commentary, dem talk sey di economy go likely fall into recession after first 1989.

Di forecast spread well, well and for one splashing campaign wey dem do for di summer of 1988, Merrill Lynch call investors to buy bond.

E say long-term interest den above 9%, dem fit drop to 7% by di end of 1989 so bondage wey dey benefit from falling rate, na correct buy.

Di firm firm also raise di percentage of bondage wey dey inside di model portfolio from 40% to 45%, den 55%.

But dis September, just when many market economists, even some of dem for Merrill Lynch, believe sey Oga, Straszheim na correct person, im carry detour if not U-turn.

Cool down di talk say recession.

Now in fact im dey predict sey di economic growth of 2.9% dis year and two thousand next year, a more optimistic outlook than sey na like four dozen top forecasters wey di Blue Chip Economic Indicators dey report.

And just recently now, Merrill Lynch cut di recommended bondholding back to 50%.

While e be like sey di ting sha, na small ting o, Merrill Lynch manage, or overseen some three three billion inside retail account wey include everyting from mutual fund to individual annuity.

Two people wey dem know well well wey dey call Mr. Straszheim for di first time, na David Bostian Jr and A. Gary Shilling both of dem dey run dia own New York research firm.

Oga Bost for August talk sey im macroeconomic index don dey show sey recession don dey.

Mr. Shilling, wey be Merrill Lynch chief economist from 1967 to 1971, don get heralded recession for months. My own ting be sey don throwin towel just about di time wey e suppose put im bet.

Now rocky stock market, and weak corporate profits may even further threaten di economy.

And Mr. Straszheim concede after one recent drop of manufacturing wey be sey e fit be sey we get whip wey we take, sey na just di wrong time we take do di recession, sey na di forecast be dat.

But risk business, na risk these days.

Oga, oga, broker, client, media person, push demsef, deir own ego, wall street economist, de dey forecast everyting from broad economic go reach di monthly trend.

But di seven years economic expansion don cause more dan one forecast.

Dis one no be di quiet economic science wey dem do for inside university.

Dis one na di commercial version.

Wit di new message wey dey comot for road, Oga, Straszheim dey meet confrontation wey dey often resemble di size of di client.

No sophisticated professional go dey correct every time.

Some small clients no dey see im switch.

But wit some clients, di talk fit heat small.

Dennis O'Brien wey be treasurer of Commonwealth Edison Co, for Chicago, adopt polite approach, dey wait for one opportunity to ask about di forecast.

Good hour for di Palmer House, Mr. O'Brien look up from plate after Mr. Straszheim talk something about people wey be sey deir interest na to dey nosedive. I be one of dem wey be sey de dey hope sey de go carry six billion deir debt for di books.

Na di forecast be dat? Oga O'Brien dey ask, dey try to pin down di economist.

E no succeed fully o although Mr. Straszheim talk about different kain interest scenario.

For inside one room for di conference wen dem dey call Alliance Capital Management for Minneapolis, however, di people wey dey dere, e be like sey dem dey ready to pin Mr. Straszheim for di wall.

Elfred Harrison wey be manager, shovel, Mr. Straszheim put back, e say na dis one we wan pass?

Abi we fit ask you why you change your forecast just when e be sey time don reach?

Wit e chair, Oga, Straszheim talk sey di new outlook, though e still weak, no just reason to call recession now, na all dis one wey dey dis handout wey you no wan look.

We fit still get recession, at some point.

One of Oga, Straszheim recurring theme be sey di state of di economy, no be small black, or white.

Sometimes, like now, na grey colour.

Dis one wey confuse confuse, one alliance portfolio manager to ask sey so wetin be dis Stealth recession? Anoda wahala wey be Merrill Lynch bond last year, we no dey do dat one again o, Oga Straszheim snap for rare show of irritation.

E add e say I tink sey na one better call.

E explain sey e don change mind, Oga, Straszheim later talk sey, e dey hard to pin on top one factor, e say di economy, especially di work number, e even better pass wetin e dey expected, interest rate don generally reduce, inflation never run am finish. Our business dey always look all dese tins.

E new forecast for soft landing, and e fit be sey e korrect from inside last week wey be sey, na 2.5% increase for di third quarter.

Mr. Shilling understand Mr. Straszheim problem, unbelievable pressure wey economists dey, e say you make forecast, naim you become prisoner.

E go hard o, e go hard o for one very, very big forecast, and Oga, Straszheim dey flog di hand cuff for dis trip.

E dey talk to di rectors na direct, but lowkey na im dey talk. Before, before, we don plan how much wey go come from third, and fourth quarter.

We don carry dat plan come out inside one meeting wey e do with Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc. Official for Minneapolis, di first stop.
