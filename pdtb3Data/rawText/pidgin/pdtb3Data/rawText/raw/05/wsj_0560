When Westinghouse Electric Corp. Clothe im big steam turbine plant for Lester, Pa, three years ago, e be like sey di company don pull di plug on top im old power generation business.

But now Westinghouse dey get resurgence in demand for steam, and flaming fire, and may be even join independent electric company wey dey grow.

And with di new one wey Japan go do wey be Micronesia Heavy Industries Ltd, dem don announce am last week say e go begin dey penetrate more market for overseas.

E never too tey wen West Eufrates govnor dey rule since mid-naw.

Most of dem na from independent producers instead of regulated utilities, and Westinghouse believe sey na wave of demand go dey push dem through di next six years.

Analyst pipol don gree sey revive market go increase well, well for di coming years. Russell L. Leavite wey be Salomon broder, talk sey di money wey West house dey get, de go add am kporo for di mid-1990 kporo, or e go add kporo for di mid-1990 kporo.

Di company expect sey di new generation wey dey come for U.S. over di next ten years, go reach 140,000 megawatts.

Before dis year now, de don order for four 150 megawatt advanced combustion turbine from Florida Power & Light Co, and for two 300 megawatt plant from Intercontinental Energy Corp.

Westinghouse own too dey change.

Before, di company dey take token equity plant wey be sey na kicker to close deal.

But for June dis year, goment deny say Westinghaus go raise all di money wey be sey e go build new 55 megawatt plant, sey e go get new age.

Westinghaus plant go provide electrical power for Southern California Edison Co, and backup power, and steam for di U.S.Borax & Chemical Co.

We never decide on top one strategy yet, but we fit become independent producer depending on weda na developer, or just di supplier. Theodore Stern, wey be executive vice president for di company energy, and utility group.

At dat same time, Westinghaus hope sey im venture with Mechanic go help am finish im competition, especially for di U.S.A. European competition wey be Asea Brown Brown Brown overi AG, Siemens AG, and British General Electric Co.

Under di agreement, Westinghaus go fit buy small, small gas turbine from im Japan partner, come package am, come sell am with im own generator, and oder equipment.

Di Westinghouse too go do project with Misubishi, give am edge for di developing Asia market.

In addition, di two companies go develop new steaming technology wey be sey na di plant wey Florida power dey order, and even dey use one anoder plant dey take advantage of currency fluctuation.

Even dough we go still compete for dat shikini, we fit still work together on some projects, and we go get plenty shikini flexibility according to Oga Stern wey dey contend.

This one na part of the business wey dem dey do for West Eufrates Bank and na part of the business wey dem dey do for West Eufrates Bank.

Wenthouse carefully do di agreement because earlier dis year, Justice Department challenge one proposed steam turbine joint venture with Asea Brown Boveri.

De say di current surge in demand for new power, na mostly through independent producers wey be sey unlike electricity, dem no dey regulate, and hence dem no need government approval to take construct new plant.

Westinghaus wan give half of im new order wey dey bring turbine, at least di next six years.

Despite shutdown of di company Lester and East Pittsburgh plant, di company believe sey e get di capacity to meet near term demand for di small, better manufacturing facility wey dey North Carolina.

But, Westinghouse still dey hear sey demand from independent company fit come out if fuel, like gas, or oil wey dey come out sharp, sharp, or light bulb wey dey push regulators to slow down price, na im go just come out like dat o.

Even if dat scenario happen, Westinghouse figures don ready.

Di company don dey prepare for one kind reassurance of nuclear power even though sey e never get order for one domestic nuclear plant for ten years.

John C. Marous, di chairman, and chief executive officer, na im dey expect one commercial order by 1995 for di company AP600 nuclear power plant wey dey under development, after we see one order, we expect sey e go dey on line by 2000.
