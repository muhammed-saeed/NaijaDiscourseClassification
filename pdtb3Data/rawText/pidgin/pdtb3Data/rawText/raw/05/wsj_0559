Revolutionary democracy dey kom out from dia mout.

E get one soccer stadium wey near di black township for Soweto yesterday, na eight leaders for African National Congress, seven wey don spend most of dia adult life for sekret and plan to skata government.

E pass 70,000 ANC supporters wey gather for di first ANC rally inside South Africa since di black liberation movement start for 1960.

Na only government security appartus na im dey para on top any talk, or act of provocation, leave am alone to do revolution.

But di yarn wey dey grow for inside loud dey bring out message of peace, of unity, negotiation, discipline, we stand for peace today, we stand for peace tomorrow, na Walter Sisulu wey be ANC secretary, plus five of im colleagues, na im bin do 26 years for prison before dem release am two weeks ago.

Some members of di big crowd come dey shout Viva peace, Viva!

Dis one na majesty for South Africa politics.

Government and ANC don engage for one big dance wey dem dey do to entice each oda for di negotiation table.

Pretoria dey release di ANC leaders, most of dem dey serve life, dey allow dem talk freely, hope sey di ANC go stop to dey use violence anyhow.

Di ANC leaders dey talk in tones of moderation, dey emphasise correction, dey hope sey government go encourage dem to take further steps, like free Nelson Mandela, wey be di most prominent ANC figure, and unbanning organization.

Government of President F.W. de Klerk dey use dis situation to improve im international image, and head of further economic sanctions.

Meanwhile, di many organisations for di country wey be sey back ANC dey take di opportunity take increase deir pawa, and mobilise deir supporters even though sey di state of emergency, wey don cripple black opposition, de still dey in force.

Wetin dey happen so, na im dey make pesin wey nor get sense, dey happen.

Six months now, government don approve one ANC rally.

E no fit conceivable be sey di ANC give dem chance to do rally, dem go use hand even though sey na armed gbege dem go carry go give government.

Inside one message wey dey fly for di rally, dem carry ANC president, Oliver Tambo wey no fit get legal recognition for South Africa, e con talk sey di country dey for cross road, and sey na Oga de Klerk na im go still get place among di peace makers of our country if e choose path of genuine political settlement.

But dis one no mean sey government, or ANC don dey change stripes, or sey e don dey near di oder side well, well.

Government fit reduce di way dem dey treat some areas, but e still hold some people tight.

For instance, e don release Mr. Sisulu without condition, but im pikin, Zwelakhe wey be newspaper editor, na im dey restricted for im house well, well for di day and dem no go allow am to work as journalist.

ANC talk sey dem go continue to dey push government against dem.

Talking yesterday on top of foreign governments to increase sanctions against Pretoria, and tell supporters inside di country make dem continue to dey give emergency restrictions, and racial segregation wey dem dey call apartheid, we no fit wait for government to change at its own pace.

Because di ANC still dey banned, both government wey approve di rally, and organizers wey organise am den de denied di rally.

Both of dem dey call am welcome home gathering.

But one ANC rally wey any oder name still dey na im still be ANC rally.

E never too tey wey dem release leaders sit down for one section of di stadium stand.

Among dem na one big ANC flag, and one even bigger sign wey de say ANC Lives, ANC Leads. Next one na di red flag of di outlawed South African Communist Party, wey don dey since one ANC.

For inside di stands, people wave ANC flag, wear T-shirt, sing ANC, and sing ANC.

Today, Oga Sisulu say di ANC don capture di centre stage of political life for South Africa.

As e dey inside one police helicopter wey dey fly up, and down, Oga Sisulu repeat di ANC request say make dem release all political prisoners, say make dem release all political prisoners, say make dem remove ban, and restriction for people, make dem remove all troops from black town, stop all political situation, stop all political execution.

If dem meet dis condition, e say ANC go prepare to discuss di guerrilla activity.

E say to date now, we no dey hear word o, we no dey hear word o, we no dey hear word o.

De no dey talk anyhow.

Chop one phrase from Oga de Klerk, Oga Sisulu say make all of us wey love dis country, make we dey engage for di building of a new South Africa.
