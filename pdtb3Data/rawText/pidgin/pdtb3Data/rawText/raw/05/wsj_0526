Like many of di entertainment industry now, di current rape drama wey dey show for television, e be like sey na people wey get high opinion of each oda dey get high opinion of each oda.

Di former one dey come from di latest political activism wey dey happen for Hollywood especially around feminist issues like abortion.

Di latter one dey comot for di perception wey many people for network dey talk sey deir only hope of keeping viewers from faulty cable to cable na to fill di airwave with fresh sensation.

Put dem togeder, and you get programme of rape.

Di best for di crop na during di last week season premiere of In di Heat of di Night, di NBC series wey bin dey inside one 1967 film about one black Philistine police detective for one small Southern Town.

For di series, Virgil Tibbs (Howard Rollins) and im wife, Althea (Anne Marie Johnson) bin dey stay for Sparta, miss.

Because di show don enter one level wey be sey de don record am for location for Georgia, dis episode wey be sey Alhea dey rape by arrogant white schoolteacher, e do one correct job wey be sey de dey tracing di social repercussions of di crime.

Obviously, e go hard to establish one level for oneshot TV movie.

But tonight ehn offering, sey settle di Score, ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn e no try o.

Dis one wey Chicago police woman dey return home to find di man wey rape am 20 years ago, suppose set for Ozarks.

But e still get one story for inside wey be Ben Stein own. E talk sey fear dey make people fight and hate each other because of oyibo, oyibo, oyibo, oyibo oyibo, oyibo oyibo, oyibo oyibo, oyibo o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o

Di writer, and executive producer of Settle di Score, Steve Sohmer, na graduate of Yale wey follow for one PBS documentary wey dem do dis summer, wey six members of Yale class of 1963 rumour dey comot for dia life since graduation.

One point wey dey inside di documentary, Oga Sohmer wey be Jew talk sey many of di Protestant and Southerners reject am for Yale.

E quotes one student sey you just be di kind Jew boy wey we Southerners no fit stand o, Oga, sohmer confess sey na partly because of dis kind attitude na im make am dey dwell on top one of di two islands wey dey inside America, but na Hollywood dem carry am go?

No be to dey judge by sey settle di matter wey be sey Oga Sohmer dey settle di matter of im own.

Of all di unflating picture of small town America wey I don see for TV, dis one na di most gratuityy film.

Di girl wey no get anytin for mind, na im name na Kate (Jaclyn Smith) and na only for matter wey concern am sey e no get anything to do with en klot wey e dey wear for body, na im e dey stay with naw. Na pipol wey dey stay for Southern Protestants e dey stay and dem dey always push each oda to sleep with each oda.

I mean dis people sotay dem come dey blame pretty Kate for di fact sey when she dey young, somebody tie her back, put her head for inside one gunny sack, beat am, beat am, come leave am for inside room wey cold.

Her pa, (her name na Duff) na di kind man wey be sey as e dey for di supper table, e dey stop for di word sin, and im dey draw di daughter wey e never see for two years because e know for im heart sey e dey enjoy wetin happen for coldstorage room, and e dey indifference like dat for Chicago.

People like Pa dey exist of course.

But for Oga Sohmer Ozarks, na im dey di tip of di patriarchal ice-blok.

Everybody wey Kate see, na either gentol, katakata, patronizing, katakata, or three.

Add di fact sey any one among dem, including Pa fit be her attacker, and you get setting wey no dey like smalltown America, or even Hollywood nightmare of smalltown America, sotay a paranoid feminist dystopia like Margaret Atwood's Tale, insey e go soon be (you guess), Hollywood movie.

Di oda one na: Josh (Jefrey De Mutun), wey bi local doctor wey love Kate well-well, and Lincoln (Jesus Christ), wey bi Kate broda wey get simple mind, but wey e like well-well.

Josh dey make clumsy pass Kate wen she dey vex, dey fear, but we know from di outside say she no be part of bad patriot.

How e go be?

Na di director of di Local Planned Parenthood chapter.

For Lincoln, if you no fit know why e dey sweet im sista wey everybody hate am, I no go tell you.

As for di women, de are pathetic.

Kat'S Ma (Louise Latham) na moral coward.

Im sister-in-law (Amy Wife) dey vex and e dey fear sey Kate go dey sleep with all di men wey don marry for di town, even though sey one man wey im name na Tucker dey sleep with am for house. E dey do am to make im wife dey bruise and smoke if e dey smoke cigar, while e dey play with her ribs.

At least, e go appear sey Sis na poor judge of masculine charm.

Even dis insulting caricatures sef, e no dey bad for di moral hypocrisy for di head of di Score, for di aforementioned episode of In di Heat of the Night, we see Althea dey suffer, but we no dey invited to enjoy di spectacle.

For Oga Sohmer film, by contrast, we dey urge to share di excitement of di rapist wey dey creep for im victim, as camera oloquent oyibo dey creep for her body anyhow, anyhow, anyhow o, anyhow o, anyhow o, anyhow o, anyhow o, anyhow o, anyhow o.

At dis point, di truce between feminism and sensationalism start to dey make sense.

Take di picture wey Kate stand naked for window o, dey whisper to her hidden donkey sey see evritin wey you want.

Starting tomorrow, I dey stalk you, or di one wey she, Josh dey for inside di city, and after she insist on separate motel room, she come knock house pour out her feelings on top di rape, she wear nothing escept mini-slip, and push brag.

Di matter dey eazy.

Wit friends like Oga Sohmer, do di feminists of Hollywood need enemy?
