Well, di arrogant East Coast media don yarn again o (Going for di Green, editorial, Oct. 17).

I don dey stay for one big state for California since seven years now, but I dey find am hard to forget our problem when I start to do commuter work with tear rubber, wind go dey rotten, water go dey rush enter town, water go dey pour come house, water go dey pour come down, water go dey pour come back, water go dey pour come down, water go dey pour go, water go dey pour go, water go dey pour go, water go dey pour go, water go dey pour go.

Di truth be sey, e no dey easy for person to just ignore our problem, e go dey spread go everywhere for di state, e go spread go di whole world.
