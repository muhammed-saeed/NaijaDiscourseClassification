October na edgy month for di practitioners for glasnost, di official permit for more candor wey dey di nation media.

For one of di star wey dem dey callglasnost, Vitaly Korotich wey be di editor for di trailblazing weekly Ogonyok, Oct. 20 na aftanoon wen e turn from tension to elation.

Dem summon am to di Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party (Court) afta e don finish evriwhere for Savoy hotel afta e don do evritin wey e suppose do. E be like sey na eight foot e take dey float on-top one house wey dem build with cherubs. Dem put am ontop one plate wey dem dey call chouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchouchou.

Why dem dey call Oga Korotich, I tell my driver sey e dey carry my knuckle go meet di Central Committee so dat de go fit, knuckles, knuckles, slap en left palm, de feel di need from time to time to educate me.

And indeed, as e later talk, na im come dey carry di meeting.

All Presido wey be Presido Mikhail Gorbachev don dey para sey make dem take am easy, make dem sofri do anytin wey Mr. Gorbachev opposition fit use.

Government dey nervous.

According by Oga Korotich wey dey dere, Oga Gorbachev na oga patapata for di press on October 13 na im dey yarn o sey, “Make una dey careful, dey judge well!

We stand for gas, make we no smoke o!

U.S. and northern European diplomats confirm Mr. Korotich own assessment wey glasnost dey inside no immediate danger.

In fact, one Russia govnor tell one US govnor for diplomatic dinner wey no go change for di policy.

Di day afta di talk for di residence of di U.S. Ambassador, di Breeze writer of Pravda, Victor Afnasjev, dem come replace am with one classmate of Oga Gorbachev.

“Brezhvite holdover get more wahala from Oga God, Gorbachev pass di kansol wey e give di press.

At di end of di week wey dem dey call Mr. Korotich to di Central Committee, Ogonyok still show sey e dey independence by printing one poll wey show sey 35% of di Soviet Union, one plurality believe sey Mr. Gorbachev economic reform, na im go result only small wahala.

Ice -blok magazine wey dem dey call Ogonyok get plenty value.

When Oga Korotich win am for 1986, e sell 250,000 copies, today e sell 3.4 million.

Ravda too don get only 57% of wetin dey 1986.

Glasnost don make men celebrity like Oga God, Korotich.

Communist party don comot from dem slate of nominee for new Supreme Soviet, e come stand as independent candidate from im native Ukraine wey get 84% of di vote.

Di same evening wey dem summon am for one warning from di party, e come dey cheer im supporters for one rally wey dem dey call Korotich party.

But as e bi sey di tins wey don happen before, naim make am dey kwayet to si vishon.

Censorship no be invention of Marx.

Di czars no be government worker.

By dis time, around 1890, Russia don stop to dey do any kind famine.

E even direct newspaper make e no carry anytin wey fit spoil di sultan wife name.

So glassnost and e no get any value wey dem fit use take make wetin dem dey wear for Russia.

It is an honourable public relations programme launched by one single political leader during a four - year blink of history.

It is public relations of every level wey sophistication dey, wey sabi sey honesty dey progress to anoder level.

Wetin be dat point?

Ogonyok go begin yarn sey e go dey destroy imsef, sey I go dey kill mysef, sey I go dey kill mysef, sey I go dey kill mysef, sey na wetin go happen? Im answer na sey im get weakness, e dey draw line join di normalisation of Soviet society.

E reach di level wey be sey press dey report not only ontop dis pile of fault, but ontop di failure of even invisible leaders.
