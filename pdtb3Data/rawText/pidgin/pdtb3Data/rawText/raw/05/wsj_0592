Margaret Thatcher's instinctive response to di latest upkeep of her government na to promise on top di matter.

Dat fit be di last tin wey she need.

As breeze dey blow for inside last week wey be sey breeze don dey fall and wey dey fall, government dey face one big wahala wey be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im dey push.

Prime Minister, and her new chancellor of exchequer, di unbeliever John Major, na im go carry di country through something like recession to bring down inflation, and to revive di economy again.

Mrs. Datcher don come up wit di European Economic Integration starting with di European Monetary System wey Britain dey join body togeder some days ago.

Finally, government gats dey convince one small money community, and voters o, e dey carry on to achieve.

E be like sey di work wey be ten years, but di deadline na late 1991 when Mrs. Datcher dey expected to call anoda national election.

Wetin dey worry her supporters be sey economic cycle o, sey political timetable don dey come out.

She fit end her four term for one economy sickness wey dey worse wit inflation, high interest rate, heavy trade deficit.

Though Mrs. Datcher don drag through oder crises, supporters dey wonder wheder her steel, autocratic style na di correct formula today o, e get one rising fear wey be sey maybe Mrs. Thatcher style of management don become political liability for London, UBS-Phillips & Drew.

Di prime minister insist on top private advisers including one economic guru wey come outside dey criticise former oga of di Exchequer Nigel Lawson, dey confuse di financial community.

Last week, di plan to play di two experts come blow, Oga Lawson waka komot for exasperation, and Sir Alan Walters wey be di adviser come yarn sey e go resign within one hour.

Confuse fit cost.

Local traders, suspect Oga, Major no go defend di pound well, well, e come sharperly reduce di dollar, and West Germany mark.

Analysts dey expect extra jitters dis week.

A continuing slide in di pound could force government to push through anoder rise in di base rate, currently 15%.

Dat one fit cause weak economy to recession.

Economy person don dey wait for one month make im go slump, but now de say e go deep pass as e dey before.

Britain economy dey develop sharperly against no growth according to J. Paul Horne, wey be international economist wit Smith Barney, Harris Upham Co, for Paris.

Cool temper, maybe by early 1991, some people wey be economist talk sey while di grueling down wey we dey expect for fit reach 1992.

If Britain biggest business partner for Europe dey enjoy strong economic activity, e go cool down small, small as we dey expect for late 1990, and 1991.

Dat go leave Mrs. Datcher small room make e dey maneuver.

For tories to win di next election, voters go need to feel economic improvement from about one year beforehand.

Though Mrs. Datcher no need to call election until June 1992, e go prefer to do am for late 1991, if economy no give am sign of protest for about year time, e go dey very vulnerable, says John Barnes, one lecturer for London School of Economics.

De still get anoda pressing deadline for government to define deir monetary, and economic ties to di rest of di European Community.

E don send mixed signal on top di exchange rate mechanism wey dey for di European Monetary System wey dey link major EC currency.

For one June EC summit, Mrs. Thatcher appear to ease her opposition to full EMS, dem talk sey Britain go join e own inflation rate, and di EC liberalisation of capital movements.

Since den, government don comot observers wey be sey na ever wan join.

Sir Alan don bail di money wey dem dey collect for one newspaper wey dey inside America economics journal (African Economic Journal).

Dat one con produce small reaction from oga, e come dey speculation sey government go use two condition as pretext say make e no dey get full em membership.

Even till Oga God Lawson and Oga Alan comot, di tin wey dey worry di EMS fit still continue.

Sir Geoffrey Howe, deputy prime minister, and Lawson ally for di EMS, e don signal sey e go continue to dey push for early membership.

Of immediate concern be sey wheder di Thatcher government go continue o, Mr. Lawson policy of tracking money policy for West Germany Bundesbank, and dey respond on top sey dis one wey dey happen for Frankfurt government, de dey move interest.

Mrs. Datcher wey dey call Doesn'T order foreigners, Tim Congdon, wey be economist, wit Gerrard & National Holding PLC, don yarn.

Dis one wey Conservatives do around Mrs. Thatcher during di crisis, many harbour hope sey last week we go do deir vexnashon, we no go get more of dis kind vexnashon again o, na backbench Tory wey dey inside parliament o, sey party don tire for good people.

Sey na yeye tin to expect.

As long as ten years now, Mrs. Datcher don talk sey she no wan drag for her cabinet, she wan bring strong government.

On top di weekend, she say she no plan to change her style, she no be authoritarian, she tell one interviewer yesterday for London Weekend Television sey I dey stay my own sweet, reasonable self.
