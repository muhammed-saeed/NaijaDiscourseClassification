Home taping of precorded music dey cut record industry revenue, but banning home taping go cause consumers even more.

Dat na di conclusion of one independent report wey be sey na Office of Technology Assessment for di request of di House and Senate judicial committee.

Dem go release di report today.

Di report talk sey dey available for all dese advanced digital equipment like cassette recorders no be sey de increase for home copying.

Dat finding, di report dey yarn sey, dem don doubt on top di record wey dey inside sey di new generation of digital equipment go inevitably lead to enslavement of copyrighted material by home tapers.

Di recording Industry Association of America, one business group wey dem dey call Washington, D.C.E, na di goment of government put on top di matter of selling blank tape, and recording equipment to take care of kings, dem go drop am for home taping.

I tink sey na nail for di coffin for any royal tax proposal, Gary Shapiro, wey be di vice president for government, and legal affairs of di Electronic Industries Association for Washington, na im we don dey yarn since eight, nine years o, na im we don dey yarn since di recording industry o.

Di people wey dey tape most, na dem dey buy pass.

But di way wey we dey sell DAT machine for here, and oda oda countries far, far tins no suppose reach di three years wey legal wrath wey enter di agreement.

Under di law wey dey copyright, dem dey talk sey e dey good to give pikin anyhow wey e want use, weda na for im family or friends, but e no dey good to do anyhow waka.

One of di 291 page report wey dey inside di 291 page, Copyright and Home Copying, Technology Challenges di Law, most people dey consider home copying for this kind of personal use right, a right, moreover, wey di USSR do for di last year.

Di study talk sey di “ambiguous legal status ” of home copying dey make am "appropriate to examine impact on consumers, and on industry" na im di Office of Technology Assessment don prescribe any specific legislative action but e dey suggest different ways wey Congress fit take follow.

Di study also yarn sey as per new communications technology, dem dey launch new legal status of home copying more, more in order to reduce legal, and market uncertainty, and prevent sey dem dey change to copyright law through technology, and sey to find out on top of harm, and gain, na political decision, no be technical.
