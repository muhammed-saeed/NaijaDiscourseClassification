Talking dat extra bit of yielding, na big mistake especially if you no understand wetin you dey invest.

Just ask Richard Blumenfeld, one New Jersey dentist wey dey consider imsef to be very sophisticated investor.

For May 1986, Dr. Blumenfeld give Merrill Lynch & Co, about $40,000 for one federal insurance policy wey dem dey call deposit offering wey get 9% increase.

E get one time wey interest come down very, very quickly, Dr. Blumenfeld recall.

Di five years CD wey big bank dey get, na about seven45, and ten years Treasury dey pay less dan 8%.

Di CD wey dem dey call Awake!

But after almost 3 1/2 years, Merrill talk sey di investment na about $43,000 ehm, dat is just over 2% on top Dr. Blumenfeld's $40,000.

Di problem be sey di CD wey e buy for retirement, no be plain vanilla CD, but na zerocoupon CD wey dem dey sell for near market.

Di difference between price, and price wey you dey sell for maturity, na di investor return.

Better ting be sey de buy CD for secondary, or resale, market.

Because di CD get gain of thirteen4% when dey release am for 1984, and interest rate for general don reduce since dat time, part of di price wey be Dr. Blumenfeld pay na premium, plus additional money wey be sey de dey add on top di CD base, plus extra moni wey be sey de don add.

Now di thrift wey don issue di CD don dey insolvent, and Dr. Blumenfeld don hear sey di premium no be insurance under federal deposit insurance.

Di tip off came when e opened one new Merrill Lynch statement, and e found out sey di C price of di current market don fall by $9,000 in a month.

Some phone call, and one visit to im broker later, di dentist come find out sey di $9,000 drop na di current value of di premium wen e buy di CD, and sey di money no be insurance o, sey dis one na one tin wey I no know about.

E assume sey principal, and interest na im dey cover up to $100,000 naira e add.

Dr. Blumenfeld no dey unique.

Especially dis kind times wey be sey de dey reduce price, dey make am hard for investors to get gain, plenty, plenty people dey rush dey collect dia money, and dem no dey take am play.

John Markese, wey be research director for American Association of Individual Investors, one Chicago based educational group, talk sey di biggest wahala wey we get be sey investors dem, after di fact sey dem no understand wetin dem invest.

Dr. Blumenfeld sef no too understand wetin e dey buy.

E talk sey e know sey im dey get zero-coupon CD, and sey im don invest for TIGR, one kind zero-coupon Treasury card wey be sey na Merrill Lynch sell am.

But e say e no understand sey e dey buy di CD for secondary market, and e argue sey im broker no fit explain di risk well, well.

Di broker, Thomas Beairsto of Merrill Lynch (Morrill Lynch) N.J. office o, e no gree discuss di matter with one reporter as e dey talk to Merrill Lynch officials for New York.

Di officials talk sey di risk dey inside one “fact sheet ” wey dem send go all CD investors wit dem to confirm di sale.

The truth wey dey April 1986 Awake! page three talk sey : “ If the money wey you sell for one CD wey dem buy for secondary market, e high pass wetin dem dey sell for zerocoupon CD, the difference wey dem dey sell for zerocoupon CD no be insurance. You go talk about any question wey you fit ask your financial consultant.

Dr. Blumenfeld talk sey e no remember di paragraph about premium in fact sheet wey e collect, and e no know sey part of wetin e pay na premium, I assumed sey I dey buy CD as CD.

But, Merrill Lynch don gree sey if di thrift wey be sey dey issue di Dr, Blumenfeld CD, Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & Loan Association for Salina, Kan, dey liquidated, and di CD terminate, di broker go cover di premium Dr, Blumenfeld pay, plus principal, and interest till di date of liquidation reach 200,000.

Ehn no be blanket commitment, na case by case case, na im Albert Disposti wey be managing director for Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc talk sey e get one question wey be sey broders, sey dem dey fully aware of di risk, sey we no sure sey full disclosure, as we want am, dem dey do am.

Merrill Lynch talk sey e no dey possible to estimate how many investors dey inside Dr. Blumenfeld situation, but e talk sey di firm don receive only one complaint on top secondary market matter for three years.

Merrill Lynch now dey provide credit rating for di institutions wey e dey sell, wey e no dey sell for 1986.

Zerocoupon CD na only small part for di $1 trillion plus plus di ones wey dem dey sell for secondary market, even small part for di total.

Merrill Lynch say less dan 10 financial institution currently dey issue zero-coupon CD.

Still, zerocoupon CD wey get mature, different maturity still dey dere.

Because of tax wey dey put on top zero-coupin investment, tax wey person dey pay di year interest, but di one wey person dey pay before tax, na zero-coupin CD dem dey sell give tax office, wey be sey na tax deductible, and tax na school pikin go pay.

Zerocoupon CD don dey reach six to nine years, e dey valued wit times two.

But investors wey buy zerocoupon CD for secondary market, no be only people wey go surprise to learn di full amount of deir investment, no be insurance company.

People wey pay premium for standard CD wey dey sell secondary market, dem fit still see sey dose premium no be insurance if di institution wey dey sell di CD, no get money.

But di money wey de dey buy for one normal CD dey small pass di zerocoupon CD wey dey buy for one normal CD.

Anyhow di matter be, Merrill Lynch talk on top di matter, investors no suppose worry on top di uninsured premium issue unless bank, or department wey be sey de don close di CD, and deir deposits don expire before deir discharge go anoda institution.

Dr. Blumenfeld say e dey satisfied sey de don resolve im problem.

And e say e don learn lesson say you dey always watch out for yourself.

Nobody go come out for you again.
