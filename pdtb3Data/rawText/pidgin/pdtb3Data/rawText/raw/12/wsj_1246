If further experiment na success, di work go do big, big research on acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

Medicine AZT, di only treatment wey dey market now, na to just stop di spread of AIDS, no be to cure am.

But some analyst, and Japanese scientist wey know about di study wey dem do for one convention for Nagoya yesterday, don show sey dem like di study material well, well.

And di researchers demsef, dem still need to do plenty work before dem go fit talk wheder di treatment go take better for human being.

Shin yonehara, one research scientist for Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, na im talk sey di IUD wey e discover, na im identify one antitype wey dem dey call Fas-Atigen wey be part of one infected cell.

Di IUD con kill di cell.

Dr. Yonehara, and im partner Nobuyuki Kobayashi from Yamaguchi University, na im de say di antibody take remove 60% of AIDS infected cells within three days.

Some of di experiments, e kill almost all di infected cells, di researchers say.

Meanwhile, na less dan 10% of di healthy cells dem kill.

Di two of dem say dem must do more lab test, den experiment on animals.

Dem say dem dey hope to conduct tests on human patients inside U.S. by late next year.

Japan no get enough AIDS patients to take do big experiment for dat country.

Di talk spread go Japan media, and even move some pharmaceutical company dem yesterday.

But Takashi Kitamura, wey be physiology department for Japan National Institute of Health, and secretary for government AIDS, talk sey I no too dey sure of im future use of therapeutics, e say some infected cells fit no get di relevant antiseptic, and so dem no go even die after you get am.

Mitsuru Miyata wey be di editor of Nikkei Biotechnology, one leading Japanese industry magazine, na im dey yarn dis one.

Dr. Kobayashi say di IUD fit kill all infected cells.

But e, and Dr. Onehara say e get many uncertainties especially on possible side effects, especially on our IUD wey kill infected cells at very low dose dose dose dose dose one fit kill oder cells. Dr. Yonehara say we no know how our IUD take dey work for human being body.

Aids no be widespread wahala for Japan o, government talk sey na about 1,000 known carriers of di virus, but many company don do plenty, plenty research for recent years, dey hope sey dem fit cash in on possible cure.

Dr. Kitamura talk sey about 35 projects dey ground now for Japan and Japan researchers for past year don bring three possible cure for American clinical trial.

E say when scientists from di two countries go meet again for January for New Orleans, Japan go bring at least three more medicine for human testing.

AAZT na di only medicine wey dey approved for di treatment of di sick.

Wellcome PLC, one major British pharmaceutical maker, de sell di drug under di name Retrovir.

A Wellcome spokesman no gree comment on di discovery of di IUD for Japan.

But Andrew Porter, wey be drug expert for Nikko Securities Co, London, na im talk sey if de don successfully develop di product, e go mean "a potential threat to di long-term viability of Retrovir."
