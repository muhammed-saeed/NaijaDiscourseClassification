Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Jack Kemp don come out on top Federal Reserve System to reduce interest.

For one talk wey dey go on top di mortgage bankers association, Mr. Kemp break di administration public silence on top di matter say interest rate dey too high.

I dey sure sey one monetary policy for dis country wey go return interest rate, di housing stock, our industry for America, di refurbishing of our industrial system, e go help di Third World economy well, well, and e go especially affect di budget deficit.

Federal Federal Federal fund interest rate na 83% from around 9%.

Husbands wey dey inside government, de say inflation dey under control.

Wit economic growth wey dey slow, de say de believe sey di Federal Government, make e dey reduce credit even further.

But for most part, officials no dey talk to people anyhow for public, dem dey fear sey dem go just come out dey cause trouble for Federal Government.
