For one October 10 editorial page wey talk sey na World Bank Turn to Adjust, Paul Craig Roberts na im dey yarn most of di blame for wetin ail countries wey dey developing for di doorstep of World Bank.

The Watchtower be like tear rubber wey full everywhere.

One of Oga Roberts observation na sey di Bank own loan portfolio dey inside big wahala because e dey borrow am to developing countries.

Dis one no be so o!

Di reality be sey, bank finance na rock solid.

As of June 30, 1989, di day wey we don dey pass fiscal year reach now, na only four percent of wetin dey di bank account dey affected by arrears of over six months.

: Dis one na low level.

Also, di bank dey follow one kind prudent provision policy, come set up $800 million against possible loan loss.

For di same fiscal year, by di way, di bank net income na robust $1.1 billion ah after provision.

â€œBikos of di way wey di Bank take dey do business, pipol for di world dey trust di bank.

This one dey explain di triple A rating wey dey our bond bond, and we get di ability to borrow $9.3 billion for fiscal 1989 for di most advantageous terms.

Anoder one wey be sey Oga Roberts dey talk sey, di bank wey dey borrow, e don do am wey bad pass sey e go put di wrong incentives, dey give energy small, small, no be sey economic development na im dey comot for di mark.

Di reality be sey, bank loan don dey linked to policy improvement for 40 years.

Our traditional project loans don, for example, support sensible energy price for power sector, sound interest rate for credit area, and on top of public utility as efficient, autonomous agency.

Small, big, e don bear fruit.

For my home region, Latin America, many of di infrastructure base, one important building block for development, na World Bank don finance am.

Oga Roberts too dey take bank account.

Wetin dey happen on top dis type of lending?

Bank don dey adjust loan now for 10 years.

As deir name mean, de dey link dis one to far-reaching policy wey be sey as dem dey borrow country money, dey increase am on top growth path, dey add to di credit wey dem get.

Typically, dis measures include to reduce government, and parastatal in di economy, to open country wide open, to international competition, to promote development of strong private sector.

Sey support for private sector don dey worry for bank.

Over di years, e don help investors dem wey be sey na by dis three world dem take do big, big business, through loan, and investment wey International Finance Corp dey invest.

Most recently now, di Bank Group don expand to include di Multilateral Investment Investment Agency to stimulate direct foreign investment for developing countries by offering assurance on top no commercial risk, and advice to member countries on how dem go take improve dia business.

No be dis one wey one development agency do wey be sey na dem go central planning, and to di concentration of investment matter for government hand, as Oga Roberts allege.

Instead, dem dey do like sey na bank dey do am, dey do am small, small, small approach wey e go make sure sey evriwhere wey money dey, na to use am well.
