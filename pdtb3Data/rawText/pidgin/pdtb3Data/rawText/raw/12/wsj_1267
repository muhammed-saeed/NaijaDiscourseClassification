For one nondescript office wey dey south of Los Angeles, dey monitor human behaviour, dey put eye down, dey isolate, dey manipulate tings.

Dem go use one small paper wey dem take dey write di second thing wey di person wey dey give talk dey count.

For anoder stage, one elaborate chart wey get colour code, na im dey show how people opinion dey different, how dem take dey change.

Donald Vinson wey dey supervise di experiments no be Oyibo researcher.

E head Litigation Science Inc, di biggest legal consulting firm wey dey help corporate America take dey prepare for high takers matter by dey predict, and dey affect wetin jurists dey do.

In process, Litigation Sciences dey quietly, but inexexable reshape di world of law.

Little known outside di legal system, but powerhouse within, Litigation Science, unit of Saatchi & Saatchi PLC, e dey employ more than 100 psychologists, marketers, graphic artist and technicians.

Doz wey dey work for am na twenty-one.

D.S.

For example, di firm dey provide pre-judicial opinion poll, create profile of Idal, dey set up mock trial, dey set up judge matter, dey set up judge matter, dey set up judge matter, dey set up judge matter, dey set up judge matter, dey set up judge matter, dey set up judge matter, dey set up judge matter, dey set up judge matter, dey set up judge matter, dey set up judge matter, dey set up courtroom picture.

Like deir group for political consulting, and product marketing, deir advisers dey encourage deir clients to play complex, or unclear matters, simplify deir message, and provide deir target audience wit psychological desire to make di right choice.

With judgement wey dey come evriday, many companies don dey willing to pay big money for dis kind advise.

Shortly, Litigation Science help Pennzoil Co, win $10.5 billion judgement judgement against Tezaco Inc.

E advise di National Football League well, well for di most successful defence of antitrust charges by United State Football League.

And e win case for product liability suit wey get many product, from from Firestone 500 tyre to Anti-Nausea drug, bendectin.

Currently, Litigation science don increase wit more than double in size since two years.

Di 1988 na $25 million.

Meanwhile, competition dey start almost daily, dem dey produce about 300 new business, many of dem na one person shop.

Oga Vinson say di total revenue for di industry na $200 million.

Any high court case, you go know sey one side, or even two, na im dey use legal consulting.

Despite sey de ubiquity, consultants no dey completely welcome.

Some lawyers, and scholars dey see di social scientist vision of American jury system as far as di picture wey dey inside civics text, and memorial wey dey inside movie screen.

For di film wey dey di title Twelf Angry Men, di crucible of deliberation dey knock on top each oda judgement bias, dey push am to judge di matter.

After hours of quarrel, dat jury dey focus on di facts wit imperfect object.

In real life, jurists fit no dey always do like dat, but some court observers fit no know why dem no suppose dey encourage person to do like dat instead of dem to dey programme am.

Lutigation consulting, as New York court attorney Donald Zoeller take talk am, high manipulater, e come add sey di idea wey de dey sell now, sey jurist no dey make justification.

But dem dey try to cause pesin wey dey judge kase, make e nor judge anyhow.

I dey find am wahala, but Oga Zoeller sef, im dey acknowledge sey consultant fit dey very, very effective, sey if di case too big, sey almost malpractice no be to dey use am o.

Other people dey complain sey di consultants dey increase im influence, dey make up di amount of money wey we dey get for inside this kind expensive service o, sey affluent people, and corporations fit buy am, sey poor ruling in politics matter dey free, and everybody wey dey between now, na im dey at a disadvantage, and no be di kind of system wey we want.

Small time ago, people come dey find wetin dem go take dey do business, but come dey find out sey na from inside politics kpatakpata for di 1960 and 1970 e come see sey na big business matter dey come out o.

Dem use one stone wey dem dey call Harrisburg 7 take block block for 1972 wey dem dey call Daniel Berrigan and oda people.

Dat one case, na left left left left left left left left sociologists interview 252 registered voters around Harrisburg.

Di researchers con discover sey Episcopali, Presbyterian, Methodist, fundamantalistists almost dey against di defendant, so di lawyers go try stop dem for di judgement.

Di defence too don learn sey university dey do ologboranganda for di Vietnam War.

Anoda panel come add oda one.

To di extend, dat careful selection of jury wey dem kill wit 10-2 vote to acquit, and di prosecution no gree try di matter again.

Litigation consulting come o.

Di fledging science enter corporate for 1977 wen International Business Machines Corp come employ one marketing professor to help defend one complex antitrust case.

Di problem for IBM lawyer Thomas Barr and David Boies na how dem go take do dat kind technical case wey dey eazy for person to take understand.

As di trial dey progress, dem come dey find out weda di judge dey support dem.

Di solution wey di professor devise na to employ six people wey go mirror di real judgement, dem go sit down for di trial, go report to di judge.

E come brief Messrs.

Brothers and Barr wey get chance to tilt deir next day arrangement accordingly.

Na im make dem born di “shadow ” jury.

Mr. Vinson wey be di professor, collect di law bug come form Litigation science. IBM win di case.

Di ting wey dey hard for any complex case, na to hold object, and in some kind way, you no go know wetin dey for Cravath, Swaine & Moore sey anytin wey you dey find for shadow jury, na very much wetin you go just carry you go give your wife, or your friend go just carry you go.

Shadow jury na di way wey we go do dat one for systematic, and organised way.

Di approach work well for di new antitrust case wey be sey Energy Transportation Company, dem sue Santa Fe Pacific Corp sey dem dey carry semi liquefated coal, di kind case wey be sey e go make almost everybody eye glaze.

Energy Transportation retained Litigation Sciences, at di rate of 800,000 dollars to go poll, to market, profile, and shadow.

Before di final judgement start, di firm take go vote of di five shadow jurist wey dem dey pay each of dem money wey be sey na one hundred, one hundred and fifty naira.

Di jurist wey no know which side don hold dem, come decide for energy transportation, come award $500 million for damages.

Di real jury later return days wit $345 million victory for Energy transportation.

Energy transportation attorney, Harry Reasoner of Vinson & Elkins yarn sey na sometimes mistake e be, but it's better to just follow Indian rain dancer.

Forecasting, na only one part of Litigation science work.

To change di outcome of di trial, na im be di ting wey dey very, very matter.

And for di one wey don dey weak, some of di firm approach fit dey chikini.

Den jurists suppose to weigh di evidence in logical, and objective analysis.

Instead, Oga Vinson dey yarn with thousands of jurists sey dem dey start with strong hand, dey try to dey shoe well, well for di matter as e take concern di matter.

Paper polling dey help consultants to develop profile for di right type of juror.

If na case wey be sey di client dey find wetin go put am for wahala, for example, dey poor, people wey dey work, de go far o.

Person wey get master degree for classical arts wey dey do deli, it's best, Litigation science talk.

So person wey e never marry, or wey e never widow, (since na usually Litigation science dey represent defence, im work na to help lawyers identify and remove dis kind people from di judge).

For inside case of injury, Litigation science dey find how dem go take defend people wey believe sey most people, including victims, dey get wetin dem deserve.

This kind people dey also carry bad belle for person wey no fit stand, wey no fit stand, poor, black, and women.

Consultants dey help di defence lawyers to find out dose ones by requesting questions about potential jurors attitude on top volunteer work, or on top particular movie, or book.

Tiger science no dey make moral distinction.

If person wey get right to know where e suppose do reach, the lawyer go help am find out.

As Oga Vinson take talk am, we no dey control di facts.

Na dem dey.

But any lawyer go select di facts, and strategy to employ.

In our system of advocacy, di trial lawyer na duty to present di best case wey possible.

Once dem don select, di consultants go continue to dey judge wetin di jurists dey feel and dem go dey help dey judge di lawyers according to wetin dey dia mind.

Logic has a minimal role here.

More important na wetin LSI dey call psychological anchors o, some focal point wey be sey dey appeal for gut level.

For one insidejury case, one woman claim sey she injure when she fall inside water, but di fall no explain why one of her hand no colour.

Wit many times wey dem dey drag di matter go court, di defence lawyers come dey drop doubt on top di woman injury.

Di ploy work.

Di defence win.

In a classic defense of a personal injury case, consultants concentrate on top of di judge to shift di blame, di best defense in case of accident na to carry di jurists hold di victim for im, or her plight, Oga Vinson don write.

Litigation science, pretested for effectiveness sef, na im dey play big role for inside Litigation Science.

Student show, consultants talk sey people absorb information better, dey remember am longer if de receive am visually.

Deputer-generated video help, di average American dey watch seven hours for TV every day.

Dem dey very, very sophisticated na LSI graphics specialist Robert Seltzer.

Lair question still dey ground o wheder anytin dey worry.

Stephen Gillers, wey be legal adviser for New York University law school, na im dey yarn sey di process na to rehearse, but dem dey insist sey better trial lawyers don always dey sama di case o, sey de no fit esplain am all, but de do am o. Stephen Gillers, wey be legal adviser for New York University law school, sey wetin you get for here na intuition.

Many lawyers dey maintain evritin wey dey happen for di operative system as long as no one tapper wit evidence.

Others dey point out sey lawyer for small community, de dey always feel for public matter, dey use dat one dey advantage.

Litigation consulting, no be sey di outcome go favor.

Tiger science concede sey one in 20 case, e dey fall on top of wetin dey predict.

Some lawyers dey give horror tori of work wey be sey consultant pay consultant (nor be Litigation Sciences) $70,000 to interview after one big trial, after dem read more detailed interview wit di same jurist wey dey inside di American Lawyer magazine.

Some people wey dey drag for di matter talk sey na sociologist dey handle am pass wetin e dey do on top matter wey concern one jury matter, sey di essence of being a trial lawyer na to understand how people for different background take dey react to you and how you take dey present, sey Barry Ostrastra of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, wey just enter one big case against Shell oil company o.

E say im use consultant for di matter, but "found dem to useless".

But most lawyers dey accept sey market don yarn.

And di question still dey na weda di judgement system go fit still hold imsef afta di tin wey di massage dey do.

For more than a decade, Oga Etzioni wey be sociologist don dey lead di mass audience dey talk sey no reason to believe sey na just judgement dey for inside, e say di last tin wey you want do, na to dey manipulate di subconscious to make dem think better.

So wetin you go come do be sey you go make dem reason am anyhow.

To stop di work of litigation scientist, e dey suggest sey di court sharperly limit di number of lawyers wey go fit comot from di judgement panel through so-so-so complain, exclusion wey no go mean explanation.

Most civil case, judge dey allow each side three key challenges.

For complex case, sometimes, judge dey allow plenty, plenty.

Mr. Etzioni also dey suggest sey make dem no dey allow anybody wey dey inside di jurist register, (some court dey release name, and address, and researchers fit drive house, dey check credit rating, and even dey ask neighbours question). Also, im dey talk sey make dem no dey allow psychologist dey check im own.

Even some lawyers wey don consult consultants to deir advantage sef, de dey see sey de need to limit wetin dey happen.

Mr. Bois, di first lawyer to use Mr. Vinson service, don dey para sey di court go dey allow plenty jury matter (like see direcshon), or dey give jurists information. Di more wey dey go on top di matter, di more wey you go do dat kind research, na im I no dey tink sey court go dey lend deirsef to dat one.
