3 Day Embryo

APOSTLE PAUL don get one kind agric for one three days old mouse embryo for one special injection wey dey applicable to humans.

Prenatal sex wey no clean for God eye as early as sixth week now, dey common.

But di mouse experiment for Medical Research Council for London show sey agric patchage wey dey three days after dem born am, dey use one new genecopying technique.

Di experiment, e dey for many agric, beta-talassemia, one kind sirious blood anemia wey dey lead to one miss gene.

E get one inherited human disorder wey dey double for rat.

For di experiment, rat wey get di defective gene, dey mash am.

Three days afta dem born di pikin, before di woman get belle, dem wosh am outside di rat.

Di embryo still get eight identical cells.

One cell come out, come out, come out.

Di new method wey di phyrga, wey dem dey call polymerase chain reaction, na im come make plenty, plenty copies of DNA wey ordinarily get di gene, dey provide enough copies to take test.

One agric probe show sey di gene wey dey inside am dey miss, na for inside medical journal Lancet.

For di report, two molecular biologists talk sey couple wey dey high risk of passing agric dey fit use am to born pikin.

For example, infertile couples wey get di woman egg wey dey fertilise for test tube, dem dey usually get plenty egg at once.

When di fertilized cells divide into eight, one single cell for each embryo go fit get am for agric.

Better embryo fit be implantation, and bad one fit be rotting.

Or for oda couples, dem fit take am out small, come test am three days after the woman don get belle, come back if e still dey healthy or e don rotten.

AN OIL COMPANY find one side for inside the microscopic world of yeast.

For di 1970 era, when di world food crisis na major gbege, Phillips Petroleum Co, with other big big company dem, begin dey develop single-cell protein, ehn ehn e dey feed ontop non-edible materials.

Filippo find and improve one yeast wey dem dey call Micia pastoris wey make am my hormone from natural gas.

E fit still make sugar from farm waste to ehn egusi.

: â€œSingle-cell protein no dey new, and most companies don stop dem to do dis kind research.

But Phillips con dey insist, con call scientists for Salk Institute.

Dem don adapt di yeast to take make agric.

Like di bacteria wey dey inside agric, yeast fit enter human being agriment, and e go come out human being for medical use.

But di yeast agric, e big pass animal agric, e better pass agric.

So, di protein wey dey inside di yeast dey klean pass di ones wey dey inside bacteria.

Di oil company dey claim sey di yeast machine sef, e better pass bacteria for high dose wey be sey agric, agric.

Chiron Corp, Emeryville, CA, biotechnology firm dey see if de fit use di agric yeast make e dey make am agric.

Jehovah Dey Help Us No Matter Our Problem

From Outside The Body

WON LABORATE BLOOD vessels, no poking catheter, fit come out of research for AT&T Bell Laboratories.

Strok, heart attack, leg pain, and oder wahala wey dey cause acid, na im dey make di arteries block.

At present, doctors can see how badly anoda artery dey blocked only by putting a thin catheter into di artery, and injecting fluid wey dey make di artery visible on X-ray.

Na biophysicist Lynn Jelinski wey dey di AT&T unit dey talk am.

E dey depend on di fact sey some atoms dey give electrical when dem dey put am for one kind strong magnetic field.

Na di same tin wey dey use for di new MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanner dey use for hospital, instead of X-ray scan.

Bell Labs do one MRI, wey dey spin spina, wey dey spina, wey dey spina, wey dey spina, wey dey spina, wey dey spina, wey dey spina, wey dey spina, wey be di spina, wey be di spina.

Di flashing of light wey dey shine inside di blood, na im give di movie wey dem dey call stopmotion (like stopmotion) wey dey shine for disco, when strostro light dey flash).

Scientists don try on top di tiny neck artery of rats.

Dem don fit measure di minuscule movement for di artery wall as di beating heart dey raise, and reduce blood pressure. Dem first talk am for Nature, scientific journal.

De dey try dey measure blood.

Di ultimate hope na sey di technique fit identify diseased vessel.

Odds and Endures

ONE of our brothers wey come from Chile na 2,800 years. Dem talk sey wood fire no dey produce dioxins or dibenzofurans. Dem talk sey na wood wey dey burn, General Electric Co. Environmental Science and Technology magazine, almost reach 40% of the people wey dey sick, but no be 10% of the women wey dey schizophrenic, dey smell.
