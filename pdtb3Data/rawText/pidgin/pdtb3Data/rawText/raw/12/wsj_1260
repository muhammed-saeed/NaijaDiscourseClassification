Ironically, American Airlines attempt to lead industry price higher na di same issue wey you dey report for di same report wey show sey consumers too weak for di airline industry (septept 20).

You quote Robert Crandall wey be di chairman of American parent, AMR Corp, as e don yarn sey di discount for big customers go dey "Dumb", because you go go Detroit because you gats go dey buy transport wey be $175, $275, or $375.

Even if na Oga Crandall correct, im of all people must know sey our society dey depend on competition to maintain di competitive quality.

For 1986, e settle one antitrust suit wey base on tape telephone talk of am wey e dey propose to di president wey be Braniff president sey dem go raise money na 20%. (Banneiff declined).

When I tell American Airlines sey dis one wey I dey use for my MBA class, wey I dey do business ethics, e no gree answer.

Maybe sey di thing wey dey happen for industry leader dey reduce, and na one of di factors wey fit make person put mind for dat industry.
