Garry Kasparov use computer take dey fight Sunday wit world most advanced chess, come kick am anyhow, anyhow, anyhow e be like old chess.

Dem play black for di first ball, but di man champion come use deep thoughtt wey dem dey call prowess take dey form one kind passive position.

E con unleash im own, wey no fit stop, e con take over.

And for di sekond time, Oga God, Kasparov come dey push well, well as Oyibo, D.T. dey push feeble, dey lost small, small.

Toh human being fit rest now.

Almost all di pipol wey dey di site dey find wetin di 26-year -old Soviet soldier go take beat di computer wey dey Pennsylvania, but e rub di machine pass wetin dem suppose rub.

And when Oga Kasparov enter ball enter, e call result.

Sey as e be iron Mike wan enter ring with 98 pounds weak, sey I go fit beat any computer for di next five years.

Im plan against D.T. come out on top of one serious study wey e do against D.T., e talk sey one grand-grand papa wey im name na Bent Larsen of Denmark and Robert Byrne of di U.S., come dey under attack, sey computer mind dey too sharp, too primitive.

Di champion apparently no worry at all about D.T. strong point.

Di Its chief builder, Feng-hsiung Hsu, dem dey call am di headchild of di Weasel for im tactical style wey dey swing up and down from bad level.

D.T.E still get one kind, kain, kain memory wey nobody fit forget. Di sex wey no clean for God eye dey spread for di hall wey dey play, for New York Academy of Art.

In fact, D.T. never comot for house, Carnegie Mellon University for Pittsburgh, but e dey communicate with im human being through telephone link.

Dem concede sey Oga God favor Oga Kasparov, but dem put deir hope for D.T. recently, de don increase kain power wey dey take dey look position, up to one million per second from 720,000.

But di handler mistake lock am with silicon chips, dem need to kryptonite.

This one con appear as ball one, one Sicilian defense by Mr. Kasparov come dey go.

No human being fit dey look everytin wey dey move, but Mr. Kasparov dey use im big, big brain, e dey always see good ones.

Afta eight move, di frame still dey di same table wen Nigel Short of Great Britain win di champion for 1980.

But di computer no play Oga, di ninet move, one key pawa thrust, and di level wey be Oga, come dey drop small, small.

Instead of to dey cast, as per standard measure wey dey protect di king, D.T. con do second rate ook maneuver for di 13th, den e put knight on top move sixteen wey be sey only two class of people go tink of dis tin wey be sey dey weak for human being, and computer, Edmar Mednis wey be sey de dey answer question for di match wen hundreds of chess fans dey dere.

By the time wey D.T. dey move, 21 trap come catch am.

It allowed Mr. Kasparov to exchange Bishop of Darkness for one of D.T. kings.

Shops wey dem dey sell for market dey sell small, but dis one wey be sey na oga kpatapata dey der with very dangerous kings, and na D.T. bishop wey dem survive survive, na passivity.

True, e be like pawan, pawan as spectators dey put am.

D.T. dey overoptise im chances, wey dey measure up well, well.

Wen many pipol wey dey look am, dey tink sey e nor get hope at-all, computer tink sey na only half of wetin dey happen.

Dem do this kind review with derision, and dem no gree make the machine resign as soon as human being go take get am. This one dey cause more problem.

While D.T. shuffle im king back and forth for defensive crocopy, Oga, Kasparov come maneuver di knight go one main post.

E still send strong breeze go deny D.T. king.

No amount of weasling for save dis ball for D.T.

Piece down, di computer resign.

Now, with di crowd wey dey inside di room wey dem do analysis, di only question wey come out na how fast Oga God, Kasparov take win game two.

With di advantage of to play white (wey be sey na first), Oga, Kasparov con dey clever against computer defence, one Queen Gambite Undertaker.

As waka dey move now, Oga, Kasparov come from one wey be sey dey move well, well, dey develop one knight instead of sey na standard bishop dey attack computer advanced knight.

(Dis one wey I dey talk so, get many clear answer to give and e no tey, I use my kween power take do yeye to forget wetin king talk.)

In a new position just after opening, computer go get serious wahala, Oga Kasparov talk am later.

For dat level, e con explain to me sey you gats create new, and computer no fit do dat one now.

For dat time, na only 11 pipol dey move go each oda and di computer stand shako.

â€œEgypt tree tree don fall rish groun, sotey e kon cost well-well.

And when de call for defensive move, D.T. come do one kind big move, come expose di queen make e kwik-kwik threaten am.

Oga Kasparov later mark say even weak club player go don avoid di queen move.

Afta twelf move, pipol wey dey der kon dey find where dem go sleep put.

On top one show wey dem dey call Phantom, Emcee Shelby Lyman show kwik-kwik die as knight sacrifice. No spectator for dis show anyhow.

Mr. Kasparov no do anytin quick, but at di end e just dey kill.

Im want make di kween do two small, two koin, but di kween no do enough for am to give di computer hope.

For person wey no get hope, di computer resign instead of di 37th move.

And Mr. Kasparov, to dey cheer, and clap, e con march go back to analysis room. In both games, I get wetin I want.

Wetin e don show, e con add, e say e get chess wey pass church.

D-Eterred, D.T. handlers just threaten to press on.

True, true three of dem go dey build successor machine for International Business Machine Corp. Promises Feng-hsiung Hsu say in three years, we go mount one better challenge.
