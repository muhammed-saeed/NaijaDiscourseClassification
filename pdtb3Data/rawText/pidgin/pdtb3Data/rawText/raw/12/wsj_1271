About 400,000 commuters dey try to find deir way through di Bay Area quake-torn transport system wey dey inside bus, dey park dey go one major road, dey sit down for one major road, or dey wait for lorry bus yesterday.

Wetin e mean be sey na better ting than average Manhattan commute.

On top of di first day wen earthquake happen, people wey dey inside town fear for di first day.

Di big building wey kill at least 61 pipol, seize di Bay Bridge, one major arterial road wey dem dey pass go east, plus di biggest ramp wey dey lead to, from Highway 101 go sout.

E go take weeks repair di bridge, and months repair some of di 101 connection.

But despite di heavy rain wey fall for di Bay Area, no traffic still dey effected, na Bay Area Rapid Transit dey carry 50% of passengers pass as e suppose be.

â€œDi first time wen I remember dat road, na only for BART wey get shape, modern rails,

Further, di two main bridge wey dey connect San Francisco with East Bay no dey charge tollo, na im dey allow traffic dey waka without stopping.

Officials too dey suspect sey traffic don benefit from step by step by major employer to dey see workers wey dey come at odd hours, or many workers dey still dey house.

Plenty, plenty commuter wey dey normally drive across di Bay Bridge, wey de shut down for many weeks because of damage to one span, at least, e fit don reach work small, small on top BART yesterday, provided sey de go see space wey de park for system jammed station.

In di best times, Bay Bridge na di worst commuter wey dey di region, many times, na im dey experience am back to 30 minutes or more.

No be sey to enter town dey easy.

Di heavy rain fall for back of road, and many of una wey dey work for una, dey go BART station, bikos na morning dem dey park am.

Sometimes, bus schedule dey cause trouble for some people wey dey commuter like Marilyn Sullivan.

E dey commute from Petaluma, Calif. E dey normally take one hour and 15 minutes through di Golden Gate Bridge wey connect San Francisco with di North Bay area.

Shebi yesterday, she still dey wait for bus stop afta three hours, e wan carry am go financial district.

E bad pass wetin I tink, e con talk sey I no know where all bus dey.

But while traffic jammer early morning for di Golden Gate, by 8 a.m., e don taya, e say na one of di smooth commuter wey I don ever go, Charles Catania, insurance broker from Mill Valley, Marin County, e con dey do holiday.

I tink sey many people just fear dey stay house, but one spokeswoman for bank america corp talk sey yesterday, bank wey dey hold company, no dey big pass on an average day.

For di San Mateo Bridge wey dey connect San Francisco Bay wit di East Bay, police con surprise on top di speed wey traffic dey waka, everybody just waka go cooperate, na im Stan Perez sey na one sergeant wit California Highway Patrol.

De get many indication sey di new work hours wey big corporation dey do, na im dey do big work.

Di Golden Gate handle many car as in yesterday, but over four hours instead of two hours crush.

Brandell Group Inc, di giant wey be sey de don institute 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.flex time arrangement wey people wey be sey dey work dey select eight hours period during dat hours to go work.

From Bechtel family, na 17,500 men dey work and na about 4,000 men dey work for San Francisco. One part dey travel from one end to di oda for East Bay.

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. dey offer two tier feem, weda na 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. or 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.

Flex time fit cut by almost 3 percent of PG&E employees wey dey do conventional 9-5 hours. Dis na wetin one spokesman tok.

Some of utility people may opt for four days work week, 10 hours to cut commuters by 20%.

Pacific Telesis Group, Flex time dey left for one working group because some of di telephone company employees go dey on top of deir site during normal business hours.

Some individuals con go for some length of time to avoid wetin dey happen for dem.

One senior vice president for Bechtel say im get up at 3 a.m. to drive into San Francisco from East Bay.

But transport oga dem dey worry sey dat kind big, big measure, and cooperation no go last.

Although one transport official talk sey drivers wey no dey use car park dey commit antisocial act, about two third of people wey dey pass di Golden Gate alone, compared to di normal 70.

And some of those wey be commuter, because no wahala, de wan go back to dia old way.
