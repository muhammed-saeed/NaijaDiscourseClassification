Di actual amount of national product wey be sey dey prepared by di Bureau of Economic Analysis for Department of Commerce, dey very, very low di rate of economic growth.

Since bureau dey estimate business sector, dey provide di numerator for productivity ratio wey di Department of Labour dey calculate, dem underestimate di growth rate artificially dey reduce productivity statistics.

If this one correct, e get important implications for macroeconomic policy, e go reduce tax matter, and oder measures to increase productivity, and real GNP.

E go affect how di board of governors feel about wetin dey happen for di state, and informate generally on top wetin dey happen on top di level.

For di late 1980s, I predict sey na big difference wey go dey happen for productivity over di next decade.

Dis one wey dey happen for di area na on top sey most of di negative force (di kind kind sickness wey dey affect us for 1970 - 1970 ) don dey get head pass as e be before.

The truth be sey, since 1981, e don pass one percent increase in productivity.

But I don expect o, dat one na one reason wey I begin dey look evidence wey show sey na yeye tin dey inside di official output.

But wetin I dey talk so, no be sey di way we take dey do dia work dey worse naw for di 1948 89 period, but wetin I dey talk now, na sey di way we dey do am don dey increase well, well (as e be sey further study go dey increase), na im I dey talk about so.

Dis bias no be anyhow.

Under statement of growth, na mostly di conservatives adopted to deal with imperfection for basic economic data.

Di number one major way wey dey go on top of error, na when person dey input input (mainly, di work, or hours) instead of output for di sector wey be sey na government, dem dey pay for household, and private non profit organisation wey be sey e dey hard to set up data.

Dis one mean sey dem no dey pay any money wey be sey dey add kobo to di kobo.

For one labour committee wey dey compare how much person wey dey work for more than two percent of Federal civilian, dem find out sey di average productivity wey dey come out from work wey dey work for more than two percent for 1980 na 1.7%.

Even if dem tink sey na half of wetin dem dey do for dis non business sector na im dis Labour Department dey estimate o sey dis one wey dey go on top di real GNP na 0.2 percent per year on average.

Federal goment dey use one kind input, instead of output, dem dey use dat one dey calculate half of private financial, and service companies as well.

Independent estimate of wetin dey happen for those industries, including one wey dey Department of Labour for banking, dey show sey na at least one percent per year between 1948 and 1988 na im dey increase for finance, and service.

Because finance, and service dey contribute 10% to final product, dey reduce overall growth by 0.15% per year.

Di second way wey dey make growth statistics na when person use inflator take dey adjust money.

I estimate sey dis koko wey Martin N. Baily, and Robert J. Gordon add oda koko wey be sey, di way di market go dey grow dey go up well, well.

Finally, di govnor go on top of state growth because dem dey give inadequate allowance for goods, and service.

For 1985, dem add one new price for computer wey get how e take dey do wetin e dey do wen e get how e take dey do wetin e dey do wen e dey change how e take dey do wetin e dey do and this one come make plenty money pass as e dey before.

Since den, further research wey dey go on top of research don show sey, at least 0.26 percent of wetin dey go on top of di growth increase.

To say di bias wey dey inside show 0.7 percent increase in total GNP.

For di private domestic market, di bias na small on top 0.5 percent.

Like dis before, na about 20 percent of wetin dey di GDP of GNP plus real private product per hour don dey climb.
