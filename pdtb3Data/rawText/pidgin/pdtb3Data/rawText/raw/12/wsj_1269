Remember doz big, big fridge wey don dey reach 30 years now?

Dem, or at least wetin small pass today wey be twins, fit dey come back.

Sey someting, anyting wey e be, e fit add like $100 to di $600, or so consumers now, de dey pay for lower priceless refrigerator.

Dis, plus oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda oda

For one of di most sweeping environmental regulation wey dey date, dat includes products wey dey sell like $135 billion for only U.S. alone, signatories agree to sharpen di use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFSC).

World wide production go finish for half by 1998.

The U.S. Senate vex for the matter well well, and dem come vote 89 to 0.

No be for outside o, George Bush wan carry CFC comot for di whole year 2000 ah wey be sey na 80 Niger State U.N. environmental meeting for Helsinki in di spring.

Dey plenty for di banishment as e dey happen.

CFCs na di main ingredient for gas wey dey popular for di Du Pont name Freon, wey dey compressed to liquid form to serve as di cooling agent for refrigeration, and air conditioning equipment.

Dem dey pump GFCs wey dey inside polyurethane to make pillow, ehn upholstery, and insulation.

Polyurethane foam na one very, very efficient insulator. Why be sey di wall wey dey for refrigerator and freezer fit dey reduce now pass as e dey before wen dem dey use glass insula.

But even dough of some estimate sey e fit cost di whole world like $100 billion between now, and year 2000 to convert to oder coolants, foaming agents, and liquid cleaners, and to redesign equipment for dis less efficient substitutes, di Montreal Protocol legions wey dey talk sey e dey worth am.

Dem insist sey, CFC dey spoil di stratos ozone layer wey dey screen some of di sun.

So as de dey see am, if not, sunburn, and skin cancer go dey plenty more, more.

Peter Teagan, wey be specialist for heat transfer, na im dey do one project for Arthur D. Little Inc, Cambridge, Mass to find alternative technology wey go allow di industry to take over CFC.

In addition to di interest of Ozone depletion, e don do well in di related topic of global warming, one theory wey be sey as e dey increase fuel wey dey come from fossil fuel, e dey create greenhouse effect wey go affect di weather for inside di world.

Na me go first admit say no complete consensus for scientific community on top one of dis wahala, na im be di kind book wey I dey read, I dey see counter-wise opinions well, well.

But di nature of di problem sotay many odas dey feel sey dem must do something quick, before all di evidence go come out.

We no fit wait.

But e must kwik-kwik?

Some atmospheric science people dey tink sey even if de release CFC, for one acceleration rate, di ozone depreciation go only dey 10% by di middle of di next century.

E dey easy to get something wey be sey na just to go higher up for U.S.

Also, e get some question wey dey for inside atmospheric science wey sabi dis subject well, well, wey be sey person fit know wetin dey happen for Ozone layer.

De generally agree sey when CFC come from earth to stratosphere, di chlorine wey dey inside am fit join di process wey be sey na im dey use di radio take divide oxygen molecules and form ozone.

But ozone creation na very natural tin, and di importance of human being based CFC wey go reduce am, na mostly matter of opinion.

Ozone layer dey always move dey move and dis one dey hard to measure.

Wetin science people don know since di late 1970 na sey hole dey for di layer over Antarctica wey dey expand, or contract dey go from year to year.

But at least we notice sey very few fridge dey for Antarctica.

And one person don see sey house fridge na closed system wey dey run for many years, weda na CFC gas, or di insulation.

Another thing wey di environmentalists dey argue be sey if substitute dey, why una go use am?

Mr. Teagan talk about substitute, but no one so far match di nonflammable, nontoxic CFC.

For example, dem fit use cane and propane take do coolant, but e dey hot.

And new lubricant too go dey for di new formulation wey be sey as in CFC dey sell products.

Mr. Tears still talk sey if di equipment wey we dey use take dey do labourer work without CFC, di power go come down, and dat one go worse di greenhouse effect.

People for Midwest wey just suffer snowstorm before, fit dey wonder where di greenhouse dey when dem need am, but make we no dey flip about grave risk.

As e dey happen, Arthur D. little, e no too dey interested to dey throw cold water for ozone depletion, and global warming theory.

E dey interested to make some money adviser on how to convert to world without CFC.

After all, big money in environmentalism.

Maybe we go ask why e be sey Du Pont don kpako, e kpako, e sama di statement give di media sey e dey withdraw CFC.

For example, France, for 1930, na im come dey do refrigeration, and air conditioning for America.

One answer be sey big company dey grow wey be sey dey fight environmental movement, dey try to cash in on top am even though sey de no too send am like dat.

Du Pont, as e take be, e get potential substitute for CFC.

Imperial Chemical Industries of di U.K. also get one, and im dey build one plant for Louisiana to produce am.

Japane chemical company dey develop deir own substitute, and deir own market now, de dey hope sey de go conquer new market.

E get oder people wey no dey mind sey new crisis dey come.

Environmental groups go soon start deir business, dem no go fit send out message stating di latest threat, and asking for money to fight am.

University professors, and consultant wey be doctor say huge market for deir service dey evaporate when de don reduce energy crisis, and thus de need for alteration energy, de need for new crises to generate new grant, and contract.

Wetin be sey, environmentalism don cause different kind of vexnashon wey dey better dan dis one wey be sey wahala plenty pass wen di wahala small.

Dat one dey tilt di debate on top of "solutions", even when some of di most sabi scientists no dey sure of di seriousness of di threats, and insistence of urgency.

E get one ting wey be sey person dey do sometin.

Consumers dey pay di bill for all dis one, dey buy refrigerator, or airconditioned car.

If de really dey buy insurance even against environmental disaster, di price go dey cheap.

But if no be impending threat, e go cost well, well.
