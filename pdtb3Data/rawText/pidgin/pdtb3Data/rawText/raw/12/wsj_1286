Why we no fit teach our pikin to read, write, and reckon?

No be sey we no sabi to, because we dey do.

Na sey we no wan.

And di reason wey we no want be sey to go school well, well, na make we no come forget some kind tins about how human being be, how human being be, especially young people, and how dem take dey do tins wey we like well, well.

Dis beliefs so dey dominate our educational establishment, media, politicians, even our parents sef, e be like sey e almost dey yeye to challenge dem.

E get one example for here.

If I go ask sample of American parents, you wish elementary school to encourage creativity in your children, di near animal answer go be yes of course, but wetin we mean specifically by creativity?

Nobody fit talk.

In practice, de deyequate am with ehn expression wey dey encourage di children sef, ehn di result na di generation of young people wey be sey deir brain dey block, and deir brain dey block only by di good opinion of demsef.

Di whole notion of "creativity" for education was (and is) part, and parcel of a romantic rebellion against di discipline wey dey (and dey) reprimand, frustration for di tins wey e fit do, and di wonderful tins wey e fit do, if still not defined, potential still dey for all our children.

No be sey na big thing for papa and mama to dey enjoy dis extra money wey man dey wear.

Happily, dese same parents want make deir pikin go school well, well as deir native fit dey understand am now, and deir sense don dey enough to know wetin dey demand.

Deir commitment to dey create adolescent illiteracy cannot survive.

American school future go dey determined by di degree wey all of us dey do so let dis common sense prevail on top di illusions wey we too dey share.

Education establishment go fight against common sense every, every every inch.

Di reasons na complex, but one simple reason wey suppose be sey: "progressive education", (as dem dey call am before), dey very, very interesting, and akordin to teacher, na im dey fit teach person well, well.

E dey good for teachers to think sey dem dey do personal development, and even better to reduce dose yeye test wey dey result of many, many disappointment.

E go also provide teachers wit superior self-definition as aproko because de go don pass course for educational psychology, and educational philosophy.

I take all dose courses for university, tink sey I go fit become schoolteacher.

Dey fit call all of dem â€˜pap'.

But e dey unfair to dump on teachers as different from educational establishment.

I sabi many schoolteachers, and on di whole, dem dey do serious teaching o.

Dem fit no dey among di best and brightest of deir generation, na very few dem be wit definition.

But make dem nor do dia work well.

Ehn all of us fit remember one, or two better teacher from school.

But wetin we go do, na for di hands of di oda pipol wey sabi work well-well and wey get mind.

Wisely, person wey dey teach compared to one family doctor.

If to say e dey o, e for no be family doctor for di first place.

If e get the power, and e serious, e dey do well for us.

Our teachers no be one important ting for our educational crisis.

Wheder dem dey pay, na problem of equity, no be school problem.

Sey na yeye libel wey our teachers dey talk sey de go train our pikin better if dey gader small, small money every year.

E be di kind libel wey teachers unions no wan dey spread for demsef because of dia narrow purpose.

E also get di kind libel politician wey dey useful because e dey help dem stand up for one important constituency level.

But no one sha, evidence sey oder tings wey dey equal, salary differential dey result for educational differential.

If dat kind evidence dey, you go know sey you go don hear am.

If we wan serious for our education, we know wetin we go do, and just as important, wetin no go do.

E get many good schools wey don spread round di kountry, some of dem dey poor for ghetto and all of dem dey send di same message.

And worst of all, na most of our schools wey we dey go, and we know wetin we dey do for educational reform before.

We really know all di tins wey we need to know, if to sey wi fit take wetin dey dis tins for awa own tins.

Wit dis respect, e go help us if our political leaders na mutin, instead of regular time to dey do, dem dey naturally inclined to echo di conventional pap, since na di least controversial option wey dey open to dem.

So for di new governor conference on top education, na Govnor Bill Clinton of Arkansas talk sey dis country need to put up a complete child development policy for children under five years, complete development policy for governors over 30 go be like sey na im dey push pass.

Wetin government, Clinton dey advocate, in effect, dey extend educational system to di pre-kindergarten years.

Wheder fine, and weda na child care, no be school.

We know sey to put eye for school early, e go improve performance for first grade, but after, di difference go quickly come.

Make we summarise wetin we know about education, and do di education reform wey dey work, and no dey work, na bad idea for person to put head for school.

Papa and mama fit blame school because their pikin no go school well.

Papa and mama suppose dey do school for house, no be for school.

Make de see sey deir pikin no dey play true, true, sey make deir pikin dey do homework, dey look di report card.

If papa, mama no dey satisfied with school, dem go fit change to anoder one.

Commit even worse one o.

See, di experience of New York City dey decisive.

Local election board, especially our big cities, don become di prey of ambition, generally corrupt, and sometimes local politicians, or would be politicians.

New York don dey push to disengage from one 20 years old commitment to dis school governance even as Chicago, and oder cities dey move to institute am.

Kai in most states, to increase education, for our current circumstances, e go con make tings go, e no go better.

Di reason na simple: Education dey happen for classroom wey money no dey reach.

Educational research dey tell us sey even small class sef, de dey zero for di academic performance of di pupils ehn even though sey sometimes e dey desirable for oder reasons.

Di new money dey enter inside di main administrative structure wey be sey bus dey carry plenty, plenty paper wey be sey de dey teach.

No be yanga, no be yanga, no be yanga wey be sey school don increase for di past quarter of a century. We dey spend pass any oda country for di world wey be sey go school dey reduce.

Na so di system dey work.

Make e student take deir academic ladder as deir academic potential.

Sey make dem no allow student to dey go secondary school even if e never sabi 3rd reach di level wey dey reach 20 years now.

Dis one mean sey to dey do wetin dey important, sey make dem no dey allow di gifted children dey flourish (though dat one dey obvious) dan to make sure sey di less gifted, de go fit get further study, or dey enter modern world of work.

Di idea sey to dey track somehow na im make sense.

Di purpose of education na to encourage young men, and women to see sey de go fit go school.

Nobody for im own mind even believe sey all of us get equal chance.

Wisely, e dey good make we dey use old textbook, many of dem, alas, dey use printing, no be new one.

Di last one na moder, trending, sometimes foolish, at best insubstantial.

De dey base on stupid psychological, and sociological theories rather than school experience.

One of di reasons wey American students dey do so poorly for maths like British, French, German, or Japanese students, na im cause di New Math wey dey American textbook, and teaching method.

Anybody wey wan appreciate just how e bi, with students wey no fit add, or subtract subtract mathematics, make e read di article wey be Caleb Nelson (imself one new maths major for Harvard) for November American Spectator.

Wahala, most important, all schools suppose get principal wit plenty authority for faculty, curriculum, and all di matter of student discipline.

Study after study (di most recent one from Brookings Institution) tell us sey di best schools na people wey no dey put hand for outside wahala, and dey go on top strong head.

Wit dat authority, na yeye accountability.

School wey dey organize dey produce students wit higher moral, and better academics.

But dis one wey I talk so, na true, as e concern all di fawol wey dey fall on-top dis one so, e nor sopraiz anybody wey hear dis one.
