For years now, na strict security dey control staff meeting for Nissan Motor Co, technical center for Tokyo western suburbs.

Employees wear identification, not only deir name, but also deir date of hire.

Nobody fit talk wetin dey im mind until di person wey senior am don talk, so young people wey dey work, wey dey happy, wey dey do well, no dey talk at all.

But for 1986, di badge, and ‘don't speak out of turn, rule was abolished, early step in a cultural revolution with all di subtlety of a freight train.

For recent years now, Nissan don start to dey do full time work, and allow people to dey dress up, even for blue jeans.

Di law sey make dem no allow staff wey dey sell motor to oda people own, na im make many people dey drive new car to get better ting.

Di company wey dey for one long time wey dem dey call NISsan don comot for Mount Fuji because of one snappy tune wey one popular Japanese singer dey sing.

And for one Japanese corporate first, na im Nissan just open di first coed company dormitory for single people for di suburban Tokyo technical center, we don do plenty internal debate about dis one, conceded to Tadahiko Fukuyama, di senior public relation, but at di end, top management don decide to follow di younger generation.

This one wey be corporate glasnost, after years wey be sey dey make small, small motor, dey lose all im oda, no be small ting now. E don dey reduce well, well, from one sleek Maxima sedan, go reach like 300 ZX wey be sey na only Japan one dey sell small car.

Di company turnaround far, far, many crucial tests just dey begin.

But di small progress wey e take dey do now, e still dey important for companies wey dey suffer.

Di big one be sey, company culture no fit change radically unless sey na only people wey dey top management go first admit sey tins don spoil, na im go come out for open position.

Atsushi Muramatsu, Nissan executive vice president for finance, na im don set di tone for December 1986 when di company dey go ahead of di first operating loss wey one Japanese company dey lose since di National Postwar recovery, na im be di time of self-criticism to discover wetin dey worry us.

Yutaka Kume wey take supavise Nissan when e contest for June 1985, na im add am simply sey I dey very disappointed.

No wonder.

NISsan, wey be Japan second oga, and Japan fourth oga, na im dey win di race, no be only im big rival, Toyota Motor Corp, but na Honda Motor Co, di most popular Japanese car company for U.S., but na relative pipsqueak dey win di race for Japan.

NISsan market share for Japan don dey fall since di beginning of di decade.

U.S. dey sell tazon times tazon, bikos of money wey dey increase for you.

Di worst part be sey na for inside carpenter, na dere na im dey manage di fight, cronyism, and corporate rigidity.

Make we see wetin happen to Satoko Kitada wey dey 30 years, wey join Nissan for 1982.

Dat time, dey do work very, very strictly on top of level, di oldest designer con dey do on top computer, she con remember sey di next level wey dey do door, na im dey do am.

If new person enter part of di speedometer, dat one na big deal.

Dis system wey dey produce ogbonge, ogbonge cars wey consumers no just dey buy.

Desperately hope to sell, Nissan carry 5,000 middle managers, and plant workers go market.

Meanwhile, President Kume order everybody from top executives to junior designers to gotownwatch, go visit chicks for Tokyo to find insight into developing cars for trendetters.

Some of the place wey we dey go watch the film no good at all.

One group of middle men from di company headquarters for outside Tokyo suppose dey check out one trendy restaurant for di city.

But wen dem rish di door, all of dem kon dey fear to enter, bikos dem dey fear sey dem go run komot from di town.

Di oder trips dey favour dem pass.

Oga Kume bin visit Honda headquarter for Tokyo upscale Aoyama district.

E like the better light wey dey show for front of Honda motor, and for front of truck, na im e get for front of one big room wey dem dey call gloom.

After, na Nissan come borrow oda Honda, plus one engineering wey dem dey call Idere to promote inventiveness.

One engineer con get one ‘crab motor wey dey move sideways.

Dis sudden cultural shift wey dey happen just dey happen small, but e be like sey dem dey genuine, sotay some old people don even resisted.

Knouji Hori wey be di personnel manager for Nissan Technical Centre, na im dey handle di diehards for one typical Japanese fashion.

Despite di pain of adjustment, cultural revolution don begin produce big, big cars.

A year ago, di company do everything to make sure sey e get one of di best cars for di world, di one wey be sey na $17,699 Maxima, wey dey compete for big, big cars, replace am with big, big, big aeroplane.

Since den, Nissan too don launch new one of di $13,249 240sX, and 300 ZX car.

Di big one wey dem do, na 300 ZX price na im dey stand against Porche 944 wey be sey e dey start for $41,900.

In addition to di new style, di new yama, yama get more engine, more sophisticated suspension.

Three new model dey sell deir predecessor small, small.

For im home market, na only small motor wey dey do small, small, small car wey dey do small, small tings wey dey do small, small tings.

One na di pao, one small coupe wey get klot wey dem dey fold and wey get long headlight wey dey shine well-well.

NISsan initially talk sey e go sell just 10,000 paos, but sales don pass 50,000, and one year list dey for di motor.

Den e get S-... e get one oda oda oda oda oda oda oda odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo odo

NISsan come develop one Tokyo restaurant wit two machine wey dey design.

Di chair na S-Cargo seat, and gift shop dey sell some kind tings like di Pao speedometer.

All dis one don sharpen my yama, yama wey I take dey drive o, yama wey I take dey drive o, yama wey I take dey drive o.

For 1980, nissan get 29% of Japan motor market, before e begin drag eight years slide wey e dey pass through last year.

Plenty sales so far dis year na im dey sure sey e go turn tide, but even di 25% market wey e dey expect for 1989, go far no be di level wey e dey for di beginning of di decade.

NISsan concede sey e no go recouple all di market share wey dey for Japan until at least 95, and even dat time table can prove optimistic sey every other person dey go catch up wit nissan on top of first boaz, nissan on top of first boaz, nissan on top of first boaz, ni o, ni o, ni o, ni o, ni o, ni o, ni o, ni o, ni o, ni o, ni o, ni o, ni o, nika o, nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika nika jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam jam.

Na so for U.S., Nissan don grab five percent of di motor market so far dis year o, up to four percent per year.

But even dat one dey bring only Nissan only for 1987, den e go leave di company behind di balance of 5.5% for 1980, and 1982.

Why?

So far, di new one wey Nissan dey do, na mostly special car wey get limited sales potential.

Small, small motor wey dey sell small, small motor for Japan, na im dey drive small, small, small cars wey dey sell small, small, small cars.

NISsan dey hope sey e go begin change dis fall wit di new one of di Stanza compact sedan.

Di Stanza don dey face serious wahala compared to Honda big, big o, according to Toyota Camry.

But dis year, Honda don change di Accord, come change am to mid size.

Instead of di new one, nissan come reduce di base price small, e reduce di base price 6%, di money wey dem dey sell for $11,450, na im dey bring di new one, but di engine wey dey dere, get power pass am.

From di money wey dem dey sell give us na $12,345.

Di NISsan risk na sey deir low base plan go lose ehm even though sey na Detroit Big Three dem dey call am.

But on top one new motor, remitting no go work well because e cheap for di motor image, na so Thomas D. Mignanelli wey be di executive vice president for Nissan U.S. sale arm.

Even if di new one succeed, na Nissan go remain for di subcomp segment wey be sey deir Sentra no dey measure up to di Honda Civic, and Toyota Corolla.

NISsan go introduce new one wey be sey de don change am.

For di opposite side of di market, na Nissan start im luxuries infiniti division on Nov. 8 - three years after Honda pioneer for Japan, and two months after Toyota's Lexus enter market.

NISsan start to dey advertise Infiniti fully eight months before di cars hit American showroom.

Di advert wey dey show wall, rock, pussy willow, almost anyting escept di motor sef.

Di advert don make some people laugh, but dem still dey bear am because dem be like every oda person for U.S. motor advertising.

Di oder hand, na Nissan sell Infiniti for Infiniti, e no get as e be compared to wetin Toyota want for Lexus.

NISsan go build only 3,500 of di 38,000 infiniti Q45 sedan evri month, e go send about 2,000 of dem go U.S., while di rest, e go dey for Japan.

Toyota wan sell about 49,000 Lexus LS400 sedan next year for only U.S.

When I see Lexus sales projection, I con kpako, confess to Takashi Oka wey be Infiniti development team.

But upon reflection, Oga say, e conclude sey na only yama, yama we dey follow for dis slow start strategy, instead of just copying Lexus. Infiniti na yama wey be yama for di 21st century and we no dey rush to make big money right away.

Even dough de wan add two new Infiniti model next year, Infiniti go bring four total, at least five years, e add.

Dis kind days na im Nissan fit get dat strategy, even dough sey di money no too push am.

For di fiscal year wey be March 31 na im NISsan get di record of net income of 114,63 billion yen ($868 million) akordin to how much e dey make from di 20.39 billion yen wey be sey na two years before di company chop na im dem lose di money wey dem dey pay.

NISsan don increase di money wey e take dey buy, e don increase pass di price wey e take dey cut, and na im dey make Japan motor increase.

But na only 120 billion yen na im dey get inside dis fiscal year wey be sey na only 47% increase.

Di main reason be sey, for all di money wey Nissan dey pay, e no dey quick dey use am, e no dey quick.

For di last fiscal year, na only 2,3% of sales, compared to 43% for Toyota.

To help close di gap, na only Nissan just establish top level price committee.

NISsan na di only person wey be sey na im dey build only motor for inside three of di main economic hubs for di world, U.S., Japan, and Europe.

Dat one dey give am en own strategic advantage at least until im rival catch up, but also a lot of managerial headaches.

For example, inside Nissan U.S. headquarters, na 10 separate subsidiary na im dey do di manufacturing, sales, design, research, and all di rest of dem.

And for July, Nissan'S Tennessee manufacturing plant beat one United Auto Workers wey don arrange to do one kind aggressive style wey don make some workers bitter.

We don enter transitional phase wey be sey we no be Japan company again to become international company wey be sey na Japan we dey now, according to Oga Muramatsu wey be di executive vice president.

E promise sey na soon im go establish holding company wey go dey control all U.S. operations just as e dey do for Europe.

But maybe di biggest tin wey go happen na make dem no pay di full corporate debt as dem take recover.

Elready, personnel dem dey talk sey di need for phase two, cultural reform effort of some kind, we still dey close to di turnaround of dis company, and e get many tins to do o, President Kume talk.

E add sey di momentum wey we don generate no fit stop.
