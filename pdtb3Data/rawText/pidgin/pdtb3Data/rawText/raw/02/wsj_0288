Instead, na di senior administration dem talk sey di unexpected meeting wey dem do for Oga God, na im dem do am for di purpose of conducting diplomacy through very personal, and informal meetings with oder leaders.

Di two leaders go meet for Dec. 2 and three dem go do two days meeting wey dem do between U.S. and one Soviet naval vessel for Mediterranean Sea.

Di unusual meeting wey be sey de no go disturb plans for formal summit next spring, or summer wey be sey de go do arming exercise.

For one announcement yesterday, Oga Bush tell tori people inside di White House sey no be im, or Mr. Gorbachev na im dey expect any substantiation, or agreement. Instead, e talk sey di purpose na just for di two of dem to sabi, talk better ting, talk matter wide, no formal agenda.

Even di informal nature of di session, and di calculated effort to hold down expectation, di meeting fit pay big political dividend for both leaders.

Mr. Gorbachev really need to change from serious economic wahala wey e dey face for house.

American govnor don yarn sey one meeting wey dey lead for U.S., e go help boost im stature for inside Soviet politicians, and academics wey dey support am.

Dem dey criticise am for en house sey e dey move small, small, dey take eye look Mr. Gorbachev as e take do im reform, and di historic move from communism for eastern Europe.

Make one face to face meeting with Oga God, Gorbachev, even doh e no go fit shalenge am.

Senate Majority Leader, George Mitchell (did. Maine), wey don dey criticise Mr. Bush for Russia relationship, e come dey praise di Presido sey e dey arrange di meeting.

But e add say mere fact of meeting no dey do di matter of policy.

Oga Bush yarn sey di December meeting wey dem do together for Moscow, dem go do am for di "fanfare", and dem go force di two side to limit contribution to only small group of advisers. If to say na dis kind tin I go do, I for say more time, no press of social media, or mandatory joint appearance, things of dat nature for public consumption.

Union of Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, for a new talk for Moscow, na im talk sey as de two plan to do full scale summit for late summer, de bin see am useful, I go say even necessary to do interim meeting, although no be specific agreement dem dey expect, Oga Shevardnadze talk sey de no go get agenda.

If di two leaders cover di tins wey don happen for lower level, U.S.SRSR, dem go talk about human right, Soviet reform, regional dispute, relations with allies, economic cooperation, armies, and joint effort to fight narcotic, terrorism, and pollution.

Di Presido specifically talk about U.S. economic advice to Moscow.

Mr. Gorbachev don dey come outside dey beg di U.S. make dem stop all di work wey dem dey do on top Soviet trade.

E recently tell one small group of American business people for Moscow sey e dey hope to sign general trade agreement wit di U.S., maybe for di 1990 summit.

Russia dey hope sey one trade agreement go give dem Most Vored Nation status wey go reduce di money wey Soviet dey carry come U.S.

For one new koko wey talk about unemployment, for inside one magazine wey dem dey call Pravda yesterday, dem talk sey three million Soviet army don lose dia job because dem dey suffer am, and di number fit grow to 16 million by di year 2005.

Economists for Moscow now dey yarn sey di state don start one kind unemployment benefit.

But one person wey be Bush administration oga for di summit, e know sey di summit plan na to expect sey boldness go dey for di Soviet economy, or oder tings.

Sey dis one no go be big opening for major movement on top economic cooperation, or arm control, or di environment, e go come out, but in a neat way.

Instead, dis na oga patapata George Bush.

Na wetin George Bush carry come out.

George Bush wan meet one oda leader, talk to am directly.

Apart from Soviet economic, plight, and talk on top cutting strategic, and chemical weapon, one oder issue wey Soviet go soon want increase na di naval force reduction.

Wistern analysts talk sey dis one wey be sey de don set for di meeting for sea, Gorbachev no go fit press any more negotiation again for di North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and di Warsaw Pact.

Di theme don dey remain one wey be sey Soviet military people don dey do well, well for dis year.

Dem dey argue sey as Kremlin dey comot afta dem don announce sey dem go cut land force (di USSR), make e show sey dem ready to cut sea force o, Washington area of great superiority o.

One of di reason why Bush administration aides dey push to insist sey di coming meeting go be informal, sey no go dey compare di last one wey be sey na superpower gathering wey be sey before, before Presido, na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na di last one wey be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey na im be sey

Dat meeting na im cause gbege for western alliance because Oga, Reagan dey follow am dey talk sey possible nuclear weapon wey dem dey sell without sey American government talk am.

Oga Bush yarn sey e dey follow Russia pipol tok for di informal meeting by sending proposal to Mr. Gorbachev last July wey di Soviet leader readily gree.

But di Presido, and some of di top aides, and some of dem no reach many of dem for second level until di past few days.

True, many oga patapata don dey drag for some week now wey be sey Oga, bush no dey interested for dat kind informal gathering.

Though Presido bush political critics for home don dey ginger am to open anoda direct dialogue with Mr. Gorbachev, but actually, na di argument of leaders inside di Soviet Union wey carry di president come for di December meeting.

Mr. Bush decide to do di meeting after im talk for inside Europe for July wit di leaders for Poland and Hungary agri to support Mr. Gorbachev to transform Soviet Union, and to urge am make e luz im grip for Eastern Europe afta one senior aide talk.

While e dey fly come from dere, Oga, bush sign letter give Oga, Gorbachev, e say make government people do informal, informal meeting before deir formal summit next year.

Peter Gumbel for Moscow come still contribute to this topic.
