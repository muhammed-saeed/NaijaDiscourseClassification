One novelist wey dey write one drama about amateur spying fit enter inside one Clifford Stoll, but it's unlikely.

E dey also unnecessary.

Amateur spy chaser, Clifford Stoll, na real person, abi na real person e be.

E dey 37, one astronomer wey get big credentials, and some guy wey sabi do computer, im dey do im bidding.

E once describe imsef as "Berkeley Hippie", and di role well, well, obligatory ragged jeans, thick hair, reject all tings conventional, including, at least, formal marriage to im "sweetheart", Martha Matthews.

E also dey like to write wetin dey sweet us, wetin dey sweet us, wetin we dey talk, wetin we dey talk, wetin we dey talk, wetin we dey talk, wetin we dey talk, wetin we dey talk, wetin computer dey do.

In di Cuckoo egg (di two days, 326 pages, $19.95), e spin one unique story of im work wey e do for 18 months to catch one computer spy.

Di result na last spring wen West German authorities catch five young Germans, dem talk sey dem dey tief information wey dey come from computer for U.S. and Europe, and dem dey sell am to Soviet KGB.

One of dem wey be 25 years, Markus Hess of Hannover, e allegedly use di international telecom network take enter more than 30 high security machine for U.S.A.

E fit no enter any top secret file, but KGB for East Berlin don ready to pay two of im associate, Peter Carl, Dirk Brezinski, $15,000 for some of di material wey Hess collect.

De con promise again for better tings.

Oga Stoll dey call im name from di cuckoo habit of dey lay eggs for oder birds nest, dey call am surrogatory mama.

Di computer spy don discover sey one popular editing/electonic mail wey dem dey call Gnu-Emacs, fit deceive di widely circulated Unix operating system wey dem dey call AT&T.

Wit Gnu-Emacs, di spy fit use bogus (atrun) programme for di one wey dey clean up di Unixx system every five minutes.

Once de don do im cuckoo egg, e fit enter Unix, and become superuser wit access to everyting.

Mr. Stoll dey scan di sky for di Keck observatory of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory for 1986 when im grant no gree, and dem tell am make e switch to help run di lab computer.

E discover one 75 CENT discrepancy for di charges wey dem carry go different department for computer time, come trace am give one user wey dey call Hunter wey no get valid billing address.

Mr. Stoll suspected di intruder na one of dose precious students wey dey break computer.

Afta dem don track am well, well, Oga Stoll, through different clue wey dey show am sey di hackers no dey Berkeley campus, or even California.

To find am, na obsession for Oga Stoll.

He make midnight requisition of all di printer wey e fit put hand down so dat e go fit monitor all di telephone line wey dey come from lab.

After e discover sey di hacker don control one legitimate user wey im name na Joe Sventek, e come use one alarm system, one beeper, take alert am when Sventek dey on top di line.

Some nights, e go sleep under im desk.

Oga complain for im oga sey im dey neglect one oder work.

Di hacker dey use one machine wey dem dey call Berkeley take dey waka, but e still dey use one computer wey dey easy to use take dey waka ontop computer wey military and national security agencies dey use.

White Sand range, and CIA contractor Mitre Inc.

When di hacker move, Oga Stoll move too, e call up oder system managers say make dem put eye down, but make deir own system open so dat deir suspicion go too much.

Sometimes, if e be like sey di hacker dey inside one sensitive file, e go drag im keychain across di terminal to create static, or slow down di system to frustrate im quarry.

FBI initially show small interest, e get impression on top oder federal security agency dem hook up for inside legal red tape.

CIA tell am sey e no dey do domestic counterespionage.

One person learn plenty ting from dis book, or e be like sey dem cripple Federal bureaucracy. Seem to, because it's possible sey di CIA and National Security Agency dey interested with dem pass wetin dem carry come give Oga Stoll.

At last, naim help am.

Tymnet na one major network wey dey connect computer.

One of im international specialist wey im name na Steve White, catch Mr. Stoll hunt small, small, contract di hacker go West Germany.

Then West Germany come see Markus Hess.

To di extend, dem come invite Oga Stoll both CIA and NSA to brief high number on top computer thief.

: e like the funny things wey e dey do for inside this men wey get big head.

For where dem dey call Berkeley, one man wey en name bi left-feada kon dey koll am with bad belle, bikos e dey trit pipol anyhow.

E vex return.

E don begin dey vex for di hacker, dey vex for di federal govnor wey dey make national security.

At different level, na fascinating tory.

Oga Melloan na deputy editor for di Journal.
