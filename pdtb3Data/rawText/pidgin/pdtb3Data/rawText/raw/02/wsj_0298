Du Pont Co, Hewlett-Packard Co, and Los Alamos National Laboratory say dem sign three years, $11 million agriment to follow superconductor research.

Di collaboration go include at least 25 researchers, and dem go aim mostly on top of thin film of high temperature superconductors wey dey use electronics.

Di materials wey we don discover during di past three years, dem dey conduct light without wahala, promise smaller, faster computer, and oder new technology.

Join dem dey do research, especially for Japan. Companies dey try to spread risk and cost of new superconductor and dem dey meet di wahala wey dey come from other country, especially Japan.

Di latest research wey dem dey do on top of di research pact, dey add to di Du Pont's growing portfolio of investments in superconductors.

Wilmington, Del., chemicals don first sign research superconductor agreement wit Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Argonne National Laboratory.

Last year, Du Pont gree pay $4.5 million for im right to superconductor work for University of Houston.

Hewlett-Packard na Palo Alto, Calif. Computer maker.

Di Los Alamos Laboratory, one of three U.S. Department of Energy National Laboratory, wey be pilot centre, na im dey direct new supercomputer go market.
