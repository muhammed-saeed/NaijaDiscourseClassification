I happy to see sey wetin dey your Oct. 23 Centennial Journal account na one of the big things wey dey happen for our time.

Actually, about two years ago, di journal wey dey inside di money fund, na one of di 10 biggest things wey dey happen for di world of finance for di 20th century.

But di Reserve Fund, America first money fund, de no call am, no be di creator of di money fund concept, Harry Brown, and me.

We innovate for telephone redemption, daily dividend, total elimination of share certificate, and constant $1 per share price, all dis one wey dey pain us, no be sey na advert wey dey inside SEC.
