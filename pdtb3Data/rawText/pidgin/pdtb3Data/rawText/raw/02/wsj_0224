One aggressive Ford bid for Jaguar go put pressure on top GM to offer a better deal as di British company's "white knight", na dis one fit stop Jaguar make e continue to dey independent, and e go dey owned by British company.

But e never clear how GM go take ready to fight Ford for Jaguar.

People wey dey close to GM Jaguar con gree sey for now, na may be sey Ford fit shut general motor o, sey na either shootout, or na only one player for di town, one person talk.

Anoda person wey dey close to di yarn yarn sey e go hard well, well to pay nonsense money for Jaguar if anoda oda war go start now.

U.S. car analyst also note sey for now, Ford dey inside di best position to benefit from di plenty, plenty Jaguar shares wey don dey move past month for di hands of arbitrers wey dey wait for di highest takeover bid.

People wey dey study wetin happen for Jaguar don weak well well. Dem still talk sey e no reach 3% of wetin dey im hand na people wey dey work and management get am.

For inside U.S. Department of Publications, dem no gree comment on top di British government action or on top any plan wey dem dey carry come di special Jaguar shareholders meeting.

But GM people wey dey dere, de say deir hand too dey surprise dem sey di move, wey leave dem make dem think about all wetin we fit do, and discuss matter further, although GM don get U.S. approval to buy up to 15% of di Jaguar stock, but e never still reveal how many share am now.

For inside one ready statement, GM come suggest sey di plan for Jaguar fit get more value inside di long run pass di initial windfall wey investors fit get from hostile fowl bid. For deir invitation, GM talk sey dem don dey plan to develop joint venture with Jaguar wey go provide strong future for dis big British motor company, to ensure sey e go get better future for im employees, and to provide better remittance for im shareholders.

Di ting wey happen be sey, Oga Ridley talk surprise for di decision wey dem make because management don believe sey government no go first lift di golden share without first consulting di company.

True, true, government dey take calculated risk.

Oga Ridley yarn dis one on top of provoke from members of di opposition party dem wey dem accuse di administration on top sey dem don suspend one company wey dem dey call privatised company.

Di Conservative government decision may reflect on how e wan shed a politically sensitive issue well before di next election wey dem bin predict for late 1991 na im Daniel Jones, wey be di professor of motor industry management for University of Cardiff for Wales, don yarn.

Government don already get high interest rate, slow economy already, e don fall for Mrs. Thatcher cabinet gbama.
