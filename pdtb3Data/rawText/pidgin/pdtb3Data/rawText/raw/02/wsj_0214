:.START

As Yogi Berra take talk am sef, e don dey experience am now.

Cooma for shortstop, Bert Campaneris once, Oakland oga thief, effortlessly helep groundball, turn am to second.

For inside bush, Paul Blair wey Orioles win for Orioles eight time, use fine shain take dey fly.

For di mound, before di Red Sox, Tiant wey be oga for 1,001 waka, na im send one off-speed strike.

Babes, kiddies, grow up o, one fellow member wey im name na Earl Weaver, e don handle four world series now, e don handle di Gold Coast team now.

At least.

But di next few months, dese summer boys go dey revel in di Indomite.

Now wey be sey ball time don dey reach now, you see now, na time for new season to start.

Today na di debut of di Senior Professional Baseball Association, one new eight team pro football circuit after di highly successful tennis, and ball tour finish wit good salary, cable television contract, and even expansion plan.

One hundred and ninty two former great ones, wey no know anybody and wey no know anything about di 72 ball, three months time for inside special stadium for Florida and New York.

Because everybody involve, na one swig of dat elixir of youth, baseball.

One person wey dey always make you resign, na legendary St. Louis Cardinals centerfielder, Curt Flood, di league commissioner na im dey say you dey feel wan one more, one more, one more hit, one more ball.

Until di babe wey sabi play ballpark for dis spring training, na im e get anoder one wey e still get.

And no be only for di players.

Di one wey pass be sey, di lawyers wey dey do di ball matter, accountants, real estate developer, na dem just ponish about $1 million each sey dem wan be owner, sey dem go enter one gene autry, or de go get beer with Rollie finger.

Don Sider wey be di owner of West Palm Beach Tropics talk sey, nothing go better dan dis one.

Early morning Mr. Sider, one estate lawyer, pores on top of last, and testament.

Midmorrin, e wear orange, and blue uniform, so dat e go dey happy as e dey play for Dave Kingman.

E still dey among di fans wey dey dream of a season wey never end, sey I dey feel like small pikin, one car sales man wey don stop by one stretch of sunshine to slip six Campaneris card to di great man himself.

League promoters hope sey person wey don retire, and tourists go join doz wey dey die, like Mr. De Castro, and carry go pack go see di senior.

Di league na Colorado real estate developer James Morley wey talk sey e bin get idea last January when e lie down for beach for Australia.

When e send letter to give 1,250 grand leaguers di chance of anoda season, na 730 dem send am.

To di extend, na about 250 con go Florida go compete for di available slots. (Somebody wey dey play must be 35, or older, except for catchers wey dey qualify for 32, because di life wey dey inside di plate dey rough.)

Some players, lure na money up to $15,000 per month.

Oda, newly released from major, hope sey di senior league go deir bridge back into di big time.

But as de dey throw fire throway wey dey burn, and dey see old deer wey dey for sun, most dey dere to make deir fans happy again, or catch di Camaraderie of season again, or dey show demsef, and deir colleagues sey de still get am, or sometin wey dey close to am.

My fastball dey good.

Pete Broberg wey dey 39 years, na im dey do di midday heat wen Tropics camp dey.

Mr. Broberg wey start with di now defunct Washington senators, na im talk sey when im leave baseball for 1978, im no look back, for long time, im ignore ball altogether even di sports page.

Now Oga Broberg, one lawyer, im dey claim sey im go play for free, you no fit give am up wey dey easy, e say I try.

Di waka wey carry one afternoon ago drive Jim Gideon wey be one leaning 36 years old righthander to carry four months leave insurance for Texas to try out for Mr. Weaver team.

E no dey replace pitching for major, but e prove to me sey I go fit play if I stay well.

Back in 1975, late in di season, one then 21 Oga Gideon do only major league appearance of five and two third for Texas Rangers against Chicago White Sox.

E give seven hit, waka five, no decision.

Arm wahala, con force am back to di minor one di next year.

Will McEnaney once wey be stopper wit Cincinnati Big Red Machine.

E mean sey di rule wey person wey be player no fit cut am after one certain age.

Dis days na im e dey hustle to find job wey e dey do for en Chevy pickup before, and after Tropics.

While e dey drink beer after practice, e vividly recount how e take reach di Red Sox Carl yastrzemski to comot for di 1975 World Series, and repeat di feat wey e do against Yankee Roy White for 1976.

Some of di game reigning philosophers no like di idea of middle men wey wan play young man sport.

I myself no dey happy to see players wey I remember well, well from deir play, dey run up, and dey gallant about deir imperfection, na Roger Angell, New Yorker magazine resident ball sage say I feel sey people go fit remember players as dem dey.

Be yarn o, yarn o, yarn o, yarn o, yarn o, yarn o, yarn o, yarn o, yarn o, yarn o!

But ball player no gree.

Most of dem dey trim.

Some don do training, some don dey do am small, small, no be sey de don do am last, but most of dem don reach 30 years, and some dey supavise sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I no dey look anyhow o, sey I go just dey look anyhow o, sey I go just dey look anyhow o, sey I go just dey look anyhow o, sey I go just dey look anyhow o, sey I go just dey look anyhow o, sey I go just dey look anyhow o, sey I go just dey look anyhow o, sey I go just dey look anyhow o, sey I go just dey look anyhow o, sey I go just dey look anyhow o, sey I go just dey look anyhow o,

E don dey go tough league, according by di 47 years old Oga Campaneris wen e talk sey malice go plenty for dere, men wey don play hard all deir life, e no wan change mouth.

Still one person no go fit reason wheder di ball go just slow small.

When weather don beat Pompano Beach Municipal Stadium, Oga Blair wey be 45 years before Oriole, know sey im power no be di one wey e dey use now.

So e con dey adjust.

E nor crowd di plate again.

E no dey tink about house again o, just base hits.

E still talk sey di ting sweet well, well, as e dey cut di fat for di wall wey dey centre, well, well.

And make una no expect plenty complete play wey person wey be pitcher, maybe three out of 2808, na im dey laugh Mr. Fingers, wey be former Oakland reliever.

Exect tricky stuff wey dey for pitchers, na im Oga Weaver wey be manager talk am.

Expect brushback but no beanball,‚Äù na so Mcenaney talk.

E even expect stolen base, di one wey fit be Oga, Campaneris sef say if you know how to slide, no wahala now.

And expect slower fastballs, sey I no dey too young again o, sey I no dey too young again o, sey I no dey too young again o, sey I go dey throw 90 mph, but I go throw 80 pound.

Pedro Ramos wey dey 54 years for di club oldest player and one man wey dey play for Sun club don lost even more speed.

Wonder na di Red man enter im cheek, e admit di fastball wey e carry enter major, for 1955 don become slowball.

Di tin wey dey give am maximum speed na 72 mph.

But im no worry.

E go compensate wit wetin e learn from im years for di majors.

Im get good kontrol.

E go keep di ball down, move am.

After all, e say even to make love, you need experience.
