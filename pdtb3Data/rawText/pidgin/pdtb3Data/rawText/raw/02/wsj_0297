Everytin dey good as neurosurgeon Walter Levy, and colleagues go cut woman spinal for Cleveland Clinic for 1978.

Electric shock, na im dey give am leg, e dey fit monitor something wey dey affect am.

Di shock wey dey make am do nipo, nipo, nipo, nipo, nipo, nipo, nipo, nipo, nipo, nipo, nipo, nipo, nipo, nipo, nipo, nido.

Con talk sey Dr. Levy, e wake up paralyzed.

E talk sey : â€œDi damage to her motor nerve wey no fit dey control am at all along with di sensory nerves.

Di tragedy, e add to di level wey be sey e galvanize me to find way to stop dose kind similar case.

Dr. Levy answer may be with a new kind of magnetic brain probe, a device wey e, with many many U.S. researchers dey do widin.

In addition to di promise of safer spinal surgery, di probe fit improve di nidol, stroke and multiple sclerosis.

E fit be sey di device dey push di device to di one wey dey work inside di brain.

Di probe, wey be sey e dey pain, wey no dey put hand inside anything, wey be sey e dey harmless, e dey use strong magnetic field dey give fire wey dey give fire.

If position dey on top of di brain, di electrical wey dey give motor fire, na im dey give fire, na im dey give fire, na im dey give fire, na im dey give fire, and na im dey give fire.

In principle, dem go allow doctors to check di body of di motor na di way electrician take dey test one home electrical circuit by running current current.

Keith Chiappa, one neurologist wey dey conduct clinical test wit di device for Boston General Hospital, na im talk sey all we fit do na to dey patient, na to dey squeeze my fingers hard, or to dey raise your arm, na di best condition wey dey wey be sey all dose tests na subjective, when patient dey unconscious, de no dey work at all.

Dem do one kind magnetic wey dem dey call spina bifida for di eye.

For 1960, some people wey dey do magnetic study come develop one machine wey dem dey call spina bifida.

But for brain test, di nonwield machine wey be sey na patients go stand on top deir head, na one researcher for University of California for San Diego.

Di field comot for 1985 after scientists for Britain University come develop one kind small, small magnet wey fit give brain stimulation.

Since den, at least two dey come out for U.S. market, and at least 500 don dey sell.

For August, one Chicago Conference on top of dose machine attracted more than 100 researchers wey dem report on top everytin from brain mapping to physical therapy.

We no dey feel sey we fit use di device now, but we don close," na so Dr Levy wey dey University of Pittsburgh dey talk.

A problem wey e dey talk about, na sey, person wey get hormone no go fit get am when e dey sleep well, pass person wey im dey sleep well.

Di device go help indicate when surgery go help, na University of Toronto neurosurgeon.

For example, paralyzed by car accident victims, sometimes dem get damaged spine, if you preserve am by emergency surgery, na im make partial recovery.

But dose kind surgery usually no dey do because sey no sign come after injury wey go benefit.

E say di cost of magnetic receptive go be like peanut if we fit retrieve function for such people, Dr Tator talk.

Scientists dey take warning say magomago fit cause seizures for epileptics.

But no be small wahala dem report give many people wey take di device test.

Di main sensation apart from puppet jerking with invisible string, na like rap for head na im Sam Bridgers, one neurologist wey don study brain stimulator for Yale University.

One effect wey this IUD dey do na small increase for di brain hormone.

And some doctors wey don do hour of test on demsef, de go do temporary headache.

At least two company, Kaduna In, of Kennewick, Wash, and Novametrix Medical Systems Inc, of Wallingford, Conn, now de dey sell some type of di magnetic.

Di machine wey dey $12,500, na im dey cheap for medical standard, dem never approve am for U.S. for market, dem dey sell am for hand, leg, and for other non-brain areas.

Search for permission to use di probe for brain study.

For University of Kentucky, one team wey dey lead by Dean Currier, wey be physical therapy specialist, dey test am with electric shock wey dey give muscle contraction, so dat e no go waste after knee surgery.

Na so e still be for one Purdue University team wey dey lead by heart researcher W.A.Tacker wey dey find wetin go fit do to give cardiac muscle contraction.

Di device fit sometimes serve as temporary pacer, or restarter for stop heart, na so Dr Tacker wey dey do one kind prototype wey dem dey call Tacker whacker.

Di device, na im dey amazing possibol, but na brain.

For inside di stimulus, National Institute of Health science just show sey di brain dey organize motor control resources after onemputation.

Dem dey call am silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, silva, gbama, ebama, ebama.

Scientists sef dey explore wetin dey happen with di new machine too.

For di State University of New York wey dey Brooklyn, researchers flash two different type of letters put for one computer screen for human guinea pig.

When flash come, some part for person brain dey make am do magnetic stimulus.

When di joll be done, di subjects no go remember di first group of letter.

Where dat first stimulus go? Supplication to SUNY NEUREUR, Paul Maccabee, e say to answer dat one dey suggest different theories, such as precisely where, and how di brain dey process imincoming signals.

Im and oders dey talk sey di machine dey weak sotay e no dey separate memory.

Both diSUNY team, and researchers for National Magnet Laboratory for Cambridge, Mass, na dem dey work with more potent, brain stimulator.

Among other tings, di stronger device go fit summon half of wetin dey for memory, and wetin dey make person for mind go change.
