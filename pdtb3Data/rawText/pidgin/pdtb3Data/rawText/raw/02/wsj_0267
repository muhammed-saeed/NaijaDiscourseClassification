and one kover for en bench wey dem design with rose stone.

Local American Legion, na dem dey guide di road.

As di judge dey waka for di middle aisle with en black klot wey dey shine well-well, e kon get one trumpet wey dem dey call fanfare.

Many pipol dey praiz God pass ordinary king wey sidan for one village for di hill wey dey near di hill for south Eufrates mountin.

But Judge O'Kicki still dey do like sey e bi king and some dey sey na arrogant and abusive pesin e bi.

Na true sey im own kain dey extreme, but e dey show for small small communities to people wey dey judge well.

For March, nine months afta di judge sama judgement, di state prosecutor office kondicate am on top tear-tear charges wey dey allegation sey e pass 10 years wey official oppression dey for Kambria County, one dey press steel, and mining community for western Pennsylvania.

Di allegation, from thief, to bribe, to coercion, to lewdness, e paint a picture wey no dey please.

According to testimony inside public prosecute, 80-page grandjury report wey dem carry go give state attorney general, Judge O'Kicki extortional money from lawyers, muscle correct money from banks, and bullied local goment for more than ten years.

Prosecutors, according to di grand jury report, maintain sey since 1975, e don dey get big, big business wey be sey na dem dey sell beer give people wey dey sell beer, plotting big money matter for real estate wey bring alleged quarrel, set up dummy corporation to buy motor, collect insurance for im former girlfriend (na im second wife) and six bank account for Cambria County.

For inside di grand jury report, court tori be sey di judge now wey be 59 years, harrass im secretaries, come dey harrass im staff, dey beat anybody wey cross am.

Bailiffs claim sey de must chauffeur am to, and from work, moh e lawn, chop wood, fix car, even drop for house to feed im two grown mummies, Dixie and Husky.

One former bailiff come yarn sey di judge judge double cross am wit di promise of better job after e pocket $500 bribe.

Some of di allegations na just jibiti.

Two former secretaries tell grand jury sey de summon dem to di judge chamber on separate occasions to take dictation, only to find di judge in en bikini underwear.

One secretary con testify sey di judge once call am come im office, con wear nothing.

Di judge, suspended from im bench, pending im trial wey start dis week, e vexnashon on top all di allegations against am, e call am "ludicrous", and "imaginative, political demagogue", e blame di indictment on top local political feud, unhappiness, unto sey e go clear courthouse docking, and vending wey state prosecutor and prosecutor dey vex for some of im ruling against dem.

I no know which toe wey I don step o, di judge say I go find out, eventually wey push state police into action.

Even dough na some of di accusate still dey ground, dem still dey give plenty testimony to di wonderful power wey judges get for inside rural communities.

Dem dey use dat power well, well especially if na small small government wey be law give dem, no dey too give law wey dey give correct law for inside city.

Law, and client wey dey always carry matter go court for di country, go fit come di same court once in a year.

Maurice Geiger wey be di founder and director for Rural justice centre for Montpelier, Vt. Public interest group wey dey research rural justice matter talk dis one.

Oga, Geiger, lawyers dey tink twice dan to argue with judge wey go rule, dem no dey even mount, or even support support sey na im dey contest for re-lection, and sometimes to carry complain wey fit make dem lose di integrity of di judge.

E don pass two years wey Judge O'kin wey fine fine face, don dey enforce law for di local legal community.

Di pikin wey one immigrant stonemason from Slovenia born, dem born am for one small village outside Ebensburg wey dey Kambria County, come put im head for University of Pittsburgh Law School.

E graduate from top of im class, dey follow for di school law review with Richard Thornburgh wey come be governor for Pennsylvania and now U.S. attorney general.

For di law school too, Oga O'Kicki and im first wife get di first seven daughters.

E divorce im first wife three years ago, e marry daughter wey be im court clerk daughter.

Last year, Pennsylvania Supreme Court, Justice John P. Flaherty call am Mr. O'Kicki, one of di best judges, not only for Pennsylvania, but for United States, e clear sey di judge don do im share.

After e don practice law for local, dem come elect am to im first 10 years term for 1971, for 1981 e come do well.

Six years ago, Judge O'Kicki bin don vote president of Pennsylvania Conference of State Trial wit state of four judge.

Dem don consider am many times for federal district and appeal court vacancy for Pennsylvania.

And when im run for state appeal seat for 1983, Pennsylvania Bar Association come rated am "one of di best available", after e interview local lawyers.

E likely be di smartest man wey ever sit down for our bench, one former president of Kambria County's 150 member bar association, wey like most lawyers for Cambria County, no gree talk to di judge openly.

Sey im fit carry one matter put for eye wey dey blink.

For more than a decade, virtually no complain about di institution wey suppose be di bedrock of society, di banks, and di bar association....., we write one column for di tin wey dem dey call Tribune-Democrat, one newspaper wey near Johnstown, shortly afta di gist don start, say if na banker, or lawyer talk am, e no go dey under di tin wey dey happen today.

Officials wit di Pennsylvania Judicial and Review Board, di arm of di state wey dey investigate judicial misconduct, counter wey be sey dem no get any fault for inside Ebensburg na im dey yarn o, no one call us, no one call us o, one official wey dey close to di case wey be sey dem never carry di gutta go complain.

No be lawyers.

Johnstown attorney, Richard J. Green Jr., come shell out $500 give di judge over five years, e talk for testimony to grand jury sey di judge no ever sama fine to repay di money.

To di extend, Oga Green testify, e begin dey duck comot for im office instead of im go meet di judge wen e visit.

When Mr. Green win $240,000 verdict for one land condemnation case against di state for June 1983, e say Judge O'Kicki, unexpected award am anoda $100,000.

Oga Green no think am, e tell grand jury until di judge come outside afta di courtroom don clear, come suggest make dem kick back.

You no think sey I suppose get commission, or part of your fee for dis one?” Oga Green tell di judge.

Appalled, Oga Green, e never pay di money, e come testify.

But e no complain to state judgement board o, and later, e talk sey e dey fear sey na retribution e go later carry come.

Oga O'Kicki say e go respond to Oga Green allegation for im trial.

Like many Cambria County lawyer and residents wey don handle di matter before, Oga Green for here no gree dey talk for di matter.

and pesin wey akuiz di judge, nor go gri print en name.

I no get wetin I talk, and I think na wetin you go meet every oda wey you talk to for here,” na so local attorney, Edward F. Peduzzi, tok.

Anoda lawyer sef, di practice of law na to dey tear lip wen you dey small community.

One man like to dance well-well for one coffin until di oda pesin go klose di box.

Di judge see am as yeye, abrasive and ambitious pesin wey im dey practice for im front.

Dem sprinkle tea wey sweet well-well with honey from di king chair wey e use leda make. Dem scribe evribody wey dey listen to am sey make dem stop to dey whisper or make dem tear dia klot komot for en courtroom.

Four years ago, e lock nine members of Cambria County School Board for several hours after e don order to extend di school year by several weeks to make up for time when one teacher strike.

Visitors for im chamber say im fit cite precisely di years, months, weeks, and days wey remain until im go leave presiding president, e go give govnor O'Kicki di senior judge wey be sey na im go take over as state govnor.

Di judge dem dey tok sey dem dey proud of en pawa and evritin wey e don do.

My name na judge, judge O'Connor tell one car salesman for Ebensburg when e buy new Pontiac sunbird for October 1984 according to di grand jury report.

Na so de take record di sale for under di name Judge O'Kicki.

John Bognato, wey be di Presido of Cambria County, don yarn o sey even though di judge go court, no one still suspect sey dem fit do wrong, sey dem go fit do am by force.

Di arrogance of a judge, im deeanor, di way im dey handle people no be basis for di torment of complaint until di ting come out, e no get any indication wey e dey do anyhow.

State investigators dey drag dat view now especially on top di judge various business wey dey ground for Kambria County.

Di judge bin dey under scrutiny for late 1987 afta state attorney general don launch one unrelated investigation into corruption matter inside Kambria County.

Di matter con focus on top di judge.

Even im routine business matter cause trouble according to grand jury report.

When di judge buy im new sunbird from James E. Black Pontiac-cadillac for Ebensburg five years ago, na so di dealerships do about di judge reputation, according to wetin di grand jury yarn.

Di dealership take extra step o to get all di paper wey be sey na pre approved by Ebensburg Local Bank, Laurel Bank.

Den, as anoda waka, na so de take carry di judge picture as e stand near im new car with sales paper for hand, proof sey e don receive di loan paper.

But when di judge receive im book, e disavised di deal, sey no amount of money, no amount of loan, no amount of loan, sey no amount of money, di judge write di bank on top im judicial stationery according to di report.

Afta, di judge kon go anoda step.

After Laurel Bank try to repost di car, one vice president come tell am make e handle one unrelated legal matter wey concern one trust account.

Di judge con write again.

I see myself in a hostile relationship with Laurel Bank, and I no ready to extend myself as far as any favour dey concern me, di judge write back for one letter wey e carry go grand jury wey talk sey maybe e fit settle my own matter with Laurel bank for near future, I fit con even change your request.

Bank acquiesce.

Dem relaunch di judge loan, reduce interest rate, accept trade wey no dey di deal before. Dem do one beat up of 1981 Chevy Citation wey di dealer gats dey repair before dem go fit sell am.

Di incident no be di only time wey di judge receive special treatment from im local bank.

Two years later, e write to complain sey di interest wey e dey pay on top one unsecured debt, na "absolutely onerous", Paul L. Kane, Laurel president di time, kpako, kpako.

Bank, e write back, dey Medimediate, dey reduce rate by three5%, as a concession to you.

Di judge talk sey e no fit tok detail how e go take defend imsef for court o, but e dey talk sey if e comot from government o, sey e go get money pass am.

Dem sell cedar and brick house outside Johntown for di money wey e dey sell give lawyers.

Di judge talk sey im dey sure sey im go return to im old bench.

E don dey reach 27 years now, the 76 charge wey dem file against am don dey reach 27 years.

Most of di allegations no dey presently pending na di charges wey state prosecutors dey drag as part of one pre-rial agreement.

Di mind of di matter wey be sey na official oppression still dey.

If I lose my position, my career, my pension, my home, and investment, di judge say na my God and I know sey I dey innocent.
