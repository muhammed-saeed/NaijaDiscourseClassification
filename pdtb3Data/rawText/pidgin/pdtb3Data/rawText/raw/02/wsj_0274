Di International Bank of Japan (wey dey claim sey na di biggest japanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpanpan

And afta one Fannie Mae seminar dis week, e promise to draw hundreds prospective investors, wey be sey de fit channel tens of billion dollars into di market in di next few years.

Last year, na only few big investors dey interested, according to Kinji Kato, wey be vice president for international arm of Nomura Securities Co o, sey dis year, some investors don dey change policy, and investment well, well. At least, e talk sey, strong demand wey dey borrow borrow, na im fit help reduce interest.

At di moment, nomura, na im be di only authorized to act as primary seller of Fannie Mae instrument.

But oder Japan institution dem dey talk for their own sey de dey reason sey de wan join di 59 dealr wey be sey de dey sell group.

Dis securities dey attractive to Japanese investors for three reasons.

First, dem dey save.

While di full faith of di U.S. government, as e take dey support dem, de dey widely assumed sey government go support dem if necessary.

Remaining bond na still di long - term investment of investment.

Second, dem dey liquid.

Secondary market inside federal goment mortgage now na over $900 billion, or nearly half of di $2.2 trillion wey dey U.S. residential mortgage now.

Third, de dey offer high yield.

For di moment, some of dem dey offer 1.6 to 1.8 percent on top di Treasury securities of similar maturity.

But e get one risk wey Japan police discover when dem first dip deir toe inside market almost five years ago.

Since most mortgage fit be prepaid, or mortgage at any time, issuers go still get right to buy deir bond when e don reach maturity.

Dat na headache for long term investors since e don force dem to invest deir money, usually at lower rate pass di original mortgage wey dem carry.

Two, or three years now, di wahala be sey people no dey understand di prepayment, na im Nomura's Oga Kato talk so sey deir prepayment surprise dem well, well.

Dey carry di matter go give Japanese investors, dey borrow am monthly, because most of di mortgage na to dey collect monthly money.

But na Japan institution investors dey use quarterly, or semiannual money on top of deir investment so monthly cash flow wey be sey dey go on top of deir head.

Na im make one Japanese company take over di mortgage matter.

But de no lose touch for U.S. issue.

Since 1985, Japan investors don buy nearly 80% of di money wey Fannie Mae corporate bank dey issue to foreigner, money wey Fannie Mae dey use take buy mortgage from U.S. Bank.

And Japan investor gader almost all di two $200 million Real Estate Mortgage Conduits, one kind collateralized mortgage wey dem dey offer foreigners dis year.

Further, additional kain mortgage mortgage wey be sey de dey call Blackstone fund, sey de don reduce how de dey pay prepayment, and automatically dey invest monthly money wey be sey institution no dey gats.

Freddie Mac for many years don offer so-so subscription certificate wey guarantee sey e no go get money, and e dey offer monthly money.
