Solo woodwind player must do creative if e wan do plenty work because deir repertoire, and audience, na limited.

Di oboo musician, Heinz Holliger don cause one kind wahala o, im dey commission, and e dey interpret well, well o, so e no dey play di same Mozart, and Strauss concert again and again o.

Richard Stoltzman don do one small, small approach wey people dey use well, well.

Years ago, e don join di new music gurus, Peter Serkin, and Fred Sherry for di very countercultural chamber group Tashi wey bin dey produce modern, modern, modern, modern tings like Messiaen's scarf for di End of Time.

E get one man wey im name na Clarence, e don drop missionary work for some time (though di old Tashi still survive), but now e don start to dey play music, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey play, dey

Just di ting for Vivaldi-Abrunch set, di yuppie audience wey don embrace New Age as e dey very easy listening.

But you can't dismiss Mr. Stoltzman music, or im motive is only commercial, and lightweight.

E believe in wetin e dey play, e dey play well, well.

E get one new appearance for Metropolitan Museum, e name am A Musical Odyssey.

E just be like party, or party wey dem do well, well with some friends pass classical concert.

Clad in trademark black velvet suit, di soft statement wey dey inside, na im dey yarn sey im new album, Inner Voices, we just release am, sey im family dey front line, sey na im mama birthday na im e dey go dey play her favourite tune for di record.

E launch into Saint Saens' "Di Swan" wey dey inside di Animals, one special ting for cellists, e get fine, fine colour, e no dey bite.

Den to show sey e go fit play, e kon give di sekond movement from Saint Saens Sonata for Clarinet. Dis na one kind tin wey dey sweet to silva and e dey shine well-well.

Na so e do for di sekond half. For di sekond half, e get one pot wey e choose well-well and e nor pass five minutes, wey go disturb di pesin wey dey listin to am.

Mr. Stoltzman introduce to im colleagues colleagues: Bill Douglas, di pianist,bassoonist, and one old man from Yale, and Eddie Gomez.

Di improvisation section na one ting wey Mr. Douglas use start with one ting wey dem dey call gold rain, one ting wey go lead to di uptempo sky wey give Oga Stoltzman di opportunity to wail for one high register, and show off im finger.

Boach don follow.

Mr. Stoltzman tie di composer inside to tell am sey di great improviser of di 18th century, naim e con join with Oga, Douglas for some kain two part of di tins wey e dey do for Clarence and bassoon na im e con do for di image.

Wit di mood light, di two of dem come chanchan, come play dia wayo through some kain murderous polyrhythms wey be sey na Mr. Douglas dey alternative to Hindeth dry theory theory theory, and den, with Mr. Gomez dey shine dey play on top di tight band of di composer wey be Beboam Etudes.

But at di end of di first half, naim di pop singer wey dey inside, naim e appear for inside loud, pure voice as e dey always do, Ms. Collins sing for free about one encounter with one streetcorner wey dem dey call, “For Free", na im Mr. Stoltzman give one clarinet, and Mr. Douglas give one of di luxuriant blessings wey e dey do for Gael, dey call am.

All of dem too ollow to believe, but maybe dem for eskape am, if no be sey dem want add mtschew to add mtschew to add mtschew to add mtschew to ask for audience to join.

Dat one pass wetin dem allow am do to dey warm and to dey kwayet.

Na dis one make some of di people wey dey listen to am comot before, or after half?

Abi na because Ms. Collins don go?

Either way na to pity for Oga God, because Oga Stolzman give di biggest music of di evening just after midnight, na im Steve Reich's new York Counter, one of di series wey e dey do wey dey play music for im, or im own musical instrument.

Reich's new "Di Different Trains" for string quartet, dey use di technique appropriately.

Oga Stoltzman go don dey worry sey im audience no go fit take am, e warn us first before sey New York Counterpoint go be last 11 minute.

E also bear witness for di intricate, jazzy tapestry with Mr. Pearson's image, dis time of geometric or repeating objects, for inside kitchy mirroring of music wey dey distract Mr. Reich's piece, and Mr. Stoltzman's elegant execution.

Di rest for di concert na strait jazz and oda tins wey Charlie Parker, Ornette Coleman, Bill Douglas and Eddie Gomez rite with dis Douglas artwork.

E sweet me to hear accomplished jazz without sey I sit down for any club wey dey smoke, but like di first half, e dey easy to enter and to forget.

Dis one na future of chamber music?

Managers, and presenters dey insist sey chamber music, na soft matter, but person wey dey listen to music, na im dey enjoy am pass na im dey do am only if dey push am for big boy, and picture dey accompany am?

Wetin go remain?

Slides to illustrate Shostakovich quartet?

“Wen di evening rish, I kry well-well, bikos of di high pozishon wey Oga God give mi. I si sey di pozishon wey Oga God give mi, dey good, bikos na so Oga God wont am.

But di lite from di lampstand nor dey last and na only wen Brahms evening rish, dem dey fit si am.

Ms. Waleson na free book wey dey write for New York.
