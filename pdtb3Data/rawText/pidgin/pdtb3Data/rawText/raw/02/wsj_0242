:.START

Some U.S. government dey complain sey Presido bush dey push on top conventional arm too quick o, e go cause mistake wey fit affect security for Western Europe for many years.

Concerning di speed of di Vienna talk wey be sey de wan kill about 100,000 bombers, plus di major reductions and opposition wey dey happen for central Europe, dem dey register dem for Pentagon.

Oga Bush don call for agriment by next September for latest agriment.

But some American defense people believe sey di North Atlantic Treaty Organization go take more time chook eye on top di long term implications of di option wey dey ground.

One ting wey be sey Pentagon people wey no gree identify, dey worry sey U.S. go get one kind strong time wey be sey de go carry small, big, small bomb for deir body once Soviet army go come.

At di same time, de dey argue sey make dem reduce number of NATO soldier under treat treaty, e go increase di possibility of conventional Soviet attack unless sey West nuclear bomb wey dey West still dey for Europe.

All of dem wey dey worry on top di matter, na di British, French, and smaller NATO allies, some of dem no get enough staff wey go give dem quick answer to di matter wey we dey hear for talk wey be sey na di most complex arm programme ever wan start.

So far, no one don come outside dey para sey NATO dey in line wit di Bush position sey kukuma kukuma agriment wey be sey Soviet dey come down to parity with NATO.

But even though NATO negotiator don dey for only 10 months wey remain under Bush timetable, de still dey argue on top some kind kain question wey be sey wetin be tank? Five of di six category wey be sey de still dey negotiate, de never even define.

The thing be sey, the tank wey dey carry big gun dey weigh 25 pound or e dey carry big gun.

Soviet Union (USSR) come do one thing wey be sey dem dey give light tank, wey be sey na 10 tons.

Lega A. Grinevsky wey be di main Soviet negotiator for di confusion talk sey dis one go mean sey Soviet go destroy about 1,800 tanks, but U.S. no go lose any tank because no light dey for Europe.

But di matter don stick pass as e be o.

France, Britain, Italy, all of dem get light to take stop di talk.

And some U.S. army analysts dey worry sey di proposed Soviet redefinition wan stop di U.S. from developing lighter, more transportable, more high technology tank.

De even carry small, big plane dey go.

Soviet insisted sey de dey carry di plane enter talk, come argue for sey make dem dey carry 4,000 Russian plane because sey dem besole dey defend.

DON T THINK say any gun wey dey carry gun get offensive power.

Di dispute on top dat issue, according by one U.S. official, na potential treaty stopper, and na only President Bush, and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev go fit resolve am.

Account matter dey bring more wahala.

For example, Greece and Turkey dey suspected of over telling deir arsenal sey dem go fit comot from di hand reduction wit big, big force wey still dey push demsef.

Other nashons no know how many weapon dem get for deir own arsenal o, sey e just dey yeye on top we side, and deir own Warsaw Pact' na one of dem wey be NATO analyst.

So far, no administration for Bush administration, no arm community for Congress kommand sey dis wahala go take more time pass wetin President Bush allow.

Dem dey argue sey di biggest wahala wey go happen na sey West Africa go delay action sotay Russia go stop to dey behave like dey vex.

So what if you miss 50 thank you for one place wey dem dey call Rep. Norman Dicks (di wash), one member of di House Committee wey bin visit di talk for Vienna, di bottom line be sey if we fit get dat Warsaw Pacttu superiority come down to parity, meh we continue to dey push on to di next level.

I worry more tings sey tins go just dey unravel for di oda side sotay dem go no fit negotiate.
