Anoder kworel dey between Congress, and Bush administration on top how to pay di savings and laban, without adding to Federal budget.

For one hearing wey House Ways and Means Committee, General Accounting Office and Senate Budget Office, wey be two of dem, na dem dey advise di new S&L bailout agency make dem stop to dey collect temporary working capital money from one agency wey dem no go count on top di Federal Budget.

Officials of di Resolution Trust Corp, don talk privately sey dat kind plan na im be di best tin wey fit be to raise short cash for di bailout.

Instead, di GAO, and di Congressional Budget Office, dem talk sey make di RTC take dey consider how dem dey spend money wey dey less expensive, wey be sey na dem dey pay pass.

Di spending fit be extra from meeting deficit reduction target for Gramm-Rudman budget.

RTC don plan sey na between $50 billion to $100 billion for temporary work capital.

Sey dis one wey be sey de dey borrow so, sey de dey sell am like sey na sick, sey de dey sell am.

Di new S&L law allow RTC to issue note on top di 85% of di asset.

But higher interest rate wey dey on top of offa money, e fit add billions to di bailout, and e no go dey under Congress scrutiny, Ways and Means, go argue sey to allow dis big, big money wey no dey before federal government approval, na irresistible thing. Rep. Fortney Stark (D) wey don introduce bill to limit di RTC authority.

RTC go get to sell, or merge hundreds of insolvent thrift over di next three years.

Di new S&L bailout fee, na $50 billion dem dey sell, or dem dey merge S&L, and dem get asset, but dat one na trap.

In di meantime, di agency must raise money to maintain asset like real estate, until dem fit sell am.

Den di short term wey dem dey sell di asset, na im dem dey take pay am.

David Mullins, wey be di oga patapata of di Treasury, na im talk sey di work capital, na to allow di agency dey sell savings, and loan, plus deir bad asset, den hold di assets until de sell dem under favorable conditions.

E say e never dey determined how di RTC go take raise di money, but administration no wan put am on top di federal budget because e go do dormot wey be sey na either exemption from GrammRudman, or big money wey be sey de go carry on top di budget.

But worst possible na to raise no working capital, e say if working capital financing no dey, e say RTC fit dey slow sand sell or dump some assets through fire sale.
