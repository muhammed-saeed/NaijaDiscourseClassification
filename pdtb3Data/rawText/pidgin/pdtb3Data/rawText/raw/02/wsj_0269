As one money manager and one man wey im name na Edith Brenisen, I no too happy to read for di first issue of Garbage sey di Wall Street Journal dey use 220,000 metric tons every year, but na only 1,4% of wetin dem dey produce from recycled paper.

For example, for Los Angeles Times, na 83% recycled paper dem dey use.

With newspaper wey be di largest solid waste wey dey for inside our landfill, and with our country wey dey for pollution, all di sectors of our society, and all di business wey we dey do, na dem go dey responsible for wetin we dey use and use precious resources.

Wall Street Journal na one correct publication wey I dey like read (and must read) everyday.

Abeg make me, and countless oda readers, dey more comfortable wit di way we take dey buy una newspaper everyday, dey train una environmental standards to una everykain, and dey increase una use of recycled paper.
