Sunshine Myung Moon, di Korean evangelist wey for 1954 start di Unification Church, remain di mystery man behind one million dollar political and publishing operation wey dem do for dis country, base on American right.

But e nor get anytin wey small pass wetin yu si.‚Äù

Mr. Moon plan to change millions of Americans to im own Christianity wey e dey play for Old Testament temporal, political messiah, and den to bring the U.S. part of one united international government.

Hes original strategy (indo na brilliant innovation to spread religion) na to create new economic entity every time e wan extend and fund im different religious mission.

Tax, exempt airport, and streetcorner solicitation, na to just provide money for di upkeep.

More stable industry na to build infrastructure wey go help di Moon movement for North America as e dey for Japan and South Korea.

E go con move im movement go Europe.

But dat nor suppose bi so.

During di 1970s and early 1980s, people wey dey speak different - different language for di Unification Church and the people wey dey follow dem dey do anti-cult movement, dey deceive many of dem.

De inherit their legacy on.

Dem still dey common for di press matter wey be sey church get 10,000, or more full time members, and 25,000 people wey be sey de don dey collect as high as 80,000 members.

But inside di church document wey dey inside, show sey as e organise one big Yankee Stadium for 1976, na only about 2,000 full time church members for U.S.M.M.L, goment for one watergate-beleaguer Richard Nixon, di Koreagate scandal, and im prison sentence for income tax evasion, no help di church.

Defection, burnout, and abduction na high level.

Sey di membership number don even close to di 1976 size na di result of di "graying" of di church.

Many of di happy young "Morons" wey no gree join di Nixon regime, dem don dey produce new member now wit procreation instead of conversion.

Di alleged wealth of di Unification Church, na anoda matter of contention.

For di 1970 Xenopypt, e be like sey Oga Moon dey on a spending time, with some oda tins like di New Yorker Hotel and di nearby New York City center, where fish, na im dey kontrol oda branches for Alaska, Massachusetts, Virginia and Louisiana, before e be Christian broda and sister wey dey stay near Hudson River, dey share from Washington to Uruguay, with some bank wey dey Washington Times, New York City Tribune (originally Times Times) and one newspaper wey dem dey call Wallkillkill.

But dis buying fit deceive.

Dem dey get plenty, plenty money from South Korea, and Japan, small, small money, and silva mortgage.

Di group of young fundraiser wey dey sell flower, wey be sey de dey sell peanut, or beg, dey carry am go one place wey near near $20 million a year a year, but dat one dey compare to di money wey dem dey pay for Oga Moon International Conference, wey be sey de dey sell market, dey sell market, and all di rest of dem dey buy.

Na only im factories for Japan and Korea dey employ im followers wey dey do subsistence, dey produce everytin from rifle to tins wey dem dey sell to sharp glass. All di money dey go westward.

Virginia Commonwealth sociologist, David Bromley, wey many pass, na im don run enter di complex world of Unification Financial Financial, e don conclude sey better business, for U.S., na im dey do di exception instead of di rule.

Na so e still be for journalists, John Burgess and Michael Isikoff wey be Washington Post tori person talk sey at least $800 million na im dem carry from Japan go U.S. to handle church matter wey dey cripple for di country.

Mr. Moon two English U.S. newspaper, na im dey show how dis financial drain be.

Start up for only Washington Times alone, na close to $50 million and di total amount wey dey lost for dis journalistic black hole na $150 million by 1984.

Since den, Moon organization don launch one fine, fine magazine wey be di world, and mi, and Insight wey be di next go down.

Insiders talk sey even deir editor know sey dis book wey de dey show, plus di newspapers, na money dem dey pay.

Many American church owned businesses like 30 million naira factory wey dey produce fishing vessels don dey full.

Some parts of American Church don dey cut in half last year and again dis year.

Small time now, our meeting wey be sey na people wey no dey do oversabi go come, and people wey no dey do oversabi go come, na im dey small pass for di thousand people wey dey gather together for inside better dig, and exotic locales.

I go dere, I go dere, I go dere, I go dere, I go dere, I go dere, I go dere, I go dere, I go dere, I go dere, I go dere, I go dere, I go dere, I go dere, I go meet am, I go meet am, I go meet am, I go meet am, I go meet am, I go meet am, I go come back.

Later, e come even print three of my co-... book on top religion matter, and politics matter.

According by di former watchers of Unification, like Dr. J. Gordon Melton wey be di Institute for di Study of American Religion, almost all di work don dey reduce, as e don dey concentrate on top im empire for di Far East, everyting wey be sey, one non-... mounie senior consultant to di Unification Church recently, na interview na im dey go back to Korea, and Japan.

European politicians no gree make their government go investigate and harrass new religion.

So Oga Moon dey retreat now, dey focus on di Far East.

South Korea and Japan continue to dey profitable.

Knon'S Tong'Il industry don dey grow well, well for China wey be sey church accountants get high hopes sey dem go expand and attract Christians even after di bloody massacre for Tiananmen Square.

Pada Motor na one such investment.

According to senior consultants for di church, Oga Moon don negotiate joint venture with Chinese government to build one unit for Guangdong Province, one area of China with huge Korean minority.

Mr. Moon don gree make e add $10 million a year for 25 years keep di profit wey China dey make.

In return e don get government blessing to build churches, and spread Unification in dat country.

Anybody wey get respect for wetin e dey do, wetin e dey do, wetin e dey do, wetin e dey do, wetin e dey do, wetin e dey do, na wetin e dey do, no be wetin e dey do, but na wetin e go settle by imsef.
