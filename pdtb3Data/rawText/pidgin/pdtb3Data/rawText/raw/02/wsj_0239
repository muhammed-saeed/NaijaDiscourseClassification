I get to back French 101 wen di annoyant carry clip board dey hang for my shoulder during di coffee phase of dinner, dey ask me wheder I go like to ride for montgolfiere.

I be last minute (read interlop) go for one French court, and so far di festival wey we do for dere, na to chop, drink, smoke, sleep, and to drink.

Di man wey carry di clipboard mean sey na halfhearted attempt we wan take introduce sport come our circuit.

But as French go talk sey e dey blasphes, when e come to sport (try see Nautilus machine for Paris), my fellow conventioners no dey get any one.

Di ones wey dey my table, na only Gauloises and scourge dem talk sey make dem stop one better Saturday morning wey be sey de go dey play ball, or even montgolfing, na di first Argentine wey dey fly for di world.

That time for U.S.A., this kind of thing dey make people vex well well.

As in you went to ballooning, in France??, Americans it seems to have followed Malcolm Forbes hot air, taken to ballooning in di heady way.

Di number wey don dey fly since 25 years (wey be sey de don pass one Federal Aviation Authority, wey be lighter than air test) don increase from two hundred to ten thousand, wit some kain figures wey dey fly dey go up to 10,000.

E be like sey na around 30 balloon we dey do every year for U.S., even if na nine days Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta dem dey do am o, e dey attract around 800,000 people and more than 500 balloon, some of dem dey hold hold like Carmen Miranda, Garfield or twelf level of condom wey dey show for inside U.S.A.

But for Efesal, one town for west wey dey near France (wey bi Vosges mountin) wey dey Efesus, all dis pipol kon dey happy sey dem get evritin wey dem get.

For aftanoon for di day wen dem dey close for six a.m., dem kon draw all di attraction wey most pipol wey dey work for morning, si.

Di naggings of culture imperative, I no waste time sign up.

Di first ting wey anybody go tell you about balloon na sey di ting go dey zip for di sport prowess, or even di ting go dey low, de go tell you sey even if you hate height, you fit still dey do balloon. (I still say, no look down).

At least, when you dey ascend, wetin de no go tell you sey make you no go aloft for anyting wey you no wan collect.

I no dey talk about di traditional champagne drenching for back on top of the firm toast.

I dey talk about landing for canal.

Wise basket wey get long rope.

Wit pilot wey no dey speak English.

For morning, I start to travel (and dem dey koll di first girl, “Na virgin”) and for aftanoon, e get one fine breeze wey dey blow well, well (dem dey call am galadim for morning and e dey always happen for morning and for aftanoon. Between morning and aftanoon, plenty of fresh breeze dey come from der. Plenty fowl dey come out from di balsamariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaariaaria. Dem hold four passengers.

When no be my turn for di balloon, I follow am progress from di chase car, dey listen to di driver holiness into a walkietali.

Afta dis waka wey dem do so, reach 20 minutes, as Vosges watch di silva wey dey rush kom out from di river, and French melu dey waka dey para for di farm.

E no dey possible to feel sey God dey for im heaven wit dis kind of bird wey dey fly for di world even if your pilot for jibiti wey dey fly for inside jibiti.

To di extend, small French farmers and their small farmgirls come out from dia house. Dem put dia hand for top of dia small eye kon dey look us anyhow.

No wonder.

We dey come down straight enter deir canal.

See di oder rule of thumb for balloon na sey you no fit steer.

And your pilot, you no fit.

You fit go only up, or down by heating di air with propane burner wey go make di top of your head hot, and you fit ride di air pump.

Wey make di chaser necessary.

Most of dis people wey dey blow balloon no dey reach 2,000 feet and most of dem na 510 miles (as e take dey measure).

When di balloon dey move go front of each oda, e get small wahala wey fit make person move.

Na only when one dey ascend, or in our case dey descend ad trop dey quick, one go just dey airborne in a picnic basket.

What is he doing? Hissed my companion, na im be di only English member of di convention, na im knuckles na im knuckles na im knuckles na im knuckles na im knuckles na im knuckles na im knuckles na im knuckles na im knuckles na im e dey shout o, e dey shout o, e dey shout o, e dey shout o, e dey shout o, e dey shout o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey o, e dey

We cut back small before e come plunge us again into di drink.

To di extend, na so we just relax for one small field wey we just knack knack inside di basket as e dey roll enter mud. Half of our broders wey dey sign up, dey run enter.

I look my watch.

Make una give half anoda hour for sleep.

Back in di chaser, we go waka o, jambo, jambo, jambo, jambo, jambo, jambo, jambo, jambo, jambo, jambo, jambo, jambo, jambo, jambo.

We con meet oursef for one road wey dust full, after one clutch of Edom people wey dey watch us dey do wetin no good for light, dat be sey na half an hour we take dey drop di balloon put for ground, dey bomb di air, dey roll am up, dey jam am, dey jam am for inside trailer.

Na exercise wey we dey do morning, na im we dey follow waka go near di well.

Dis one mean sey we go back to di golf course, wey we watch some French duffers maul di first time, we siddon under Cinzano umbrella, me, I dey do espresso, and my ego.

I don close my eye well, well, I don close for like 30 minutes.

But I still look am sey di jealousy wey dey happen for U.S.A. near person.

As we dey go back to camp, all our pilot, all the passengers wey dey speak French, come dey shout enter di motor.

Me and my friend ride Alfresco for the wicker basket.

As we pursue blasphemy gendarmes, I no fit waka go front of my yansh loafer, and salute.
