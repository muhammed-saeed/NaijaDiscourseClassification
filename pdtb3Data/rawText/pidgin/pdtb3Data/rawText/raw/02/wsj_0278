Time Warner Inc. and Sony Corp. may be today's neighbours, but di two entertainment giants fit end dia partnership for many level as part of deir acrificial lawsuit against Hollywood oga dem, Peter Guber and Jon Peters.

Warner Bros. studio and Sony sign say dem don dey close to one settlement yesterday o, dey ask Los Angeles Superior Court make dem postpone hearing on top tomorrow on top Warner request for preliminary injunction wey go stop Mr. Guber and Mr. Peter to take top of di top post for Columbia Pictures Entertainment.

Inside separate statement, di two sides say de wan do â€œfurther discussion.

Sony dey enter Columbia, and Guber-Peters Entertainment Co, for two separate transaction wey dem dey do at more than $5 billion.

Warner Communications Inc, wey be Time Warner own don file one billion oda contract matter against Sony and di two producer.

Warner get five years exclusive contract wit Oga, Guber, and Oga Peters wey be sey na only for Warner Bros studio na im dem go dey do dis one.

Two side for di legal battle don dey drag accusation of duplicashon for one week, and Warner and Sony don deny each oda sey dem wan spoil each oda hope for entertainment.

But e fit be sey na small wahala, di two of dem don dey drag small, small settlement for some weeks, and some people don know sey dem fit settle di matter within a week.

Two of dem no gree comment on top di matter for di settlement discussion.

But di people wey dey dere, de talk sey na Warner no be di agent wey go collect money for di settlement.

Instead, Sony dey likely agree to allow Warner do some kind business, like di record club of Sony's CBS Records unit.

Warner don pass Sony as number one recorder, but recorder no dey for di world wide record club like CBS.

Di two sides also dey discuss certain business venture wey be sey cable rights dey inside Columbia movie.

In addition, Sony go gree to swap Columbia's 35% stake for di sprawling Burbank, CA, studio sey Warner and Columbia go do am for di old MGM studio, wey be sey dem buy am with Lorimar Telegraph Corp.

But e fit hard for di two of dem to setol each oda matter as dem dey drag each oda for di last week.

One, for example, na CBS chairman, Walter Butnikoff na im go head one committee wey go oversee Sony entertainment division including di one wey go dey inside di Sony music division.

For inside im affidavit, Oga Butnikoff deny Warner chairman Steven J. Ross sey e get one anti-Japanese bias o, sey Oga Ross don try to talk to am on top sey e wan let Sony buy CBS record two years ago.

Mr. Ross wey go be di chairman and co-chief executive officer of Time Warner after di merger, na im deny sey in im own affidavit, and dem call am vicious, and im talk sey na jibiti, irresistible, baseless, sey Warner under im leadership don start to dey do business for Japan.

Oga Ross also yarn sey im dey enjoy warm, and personal relationship wit Japanese executives, including Sony chairman, Akio Morita, wey don visit my home here.

But despite di community of Mr. Ross, and Mr. Yetnikoff, di people wey dey di Time Side of Time Warner, dem don dey more interested for one settlement wey fit produce fine business opportunity.

Time dey kom wen di pesin wey dey manage di company, wey bi N.J. Nicholas, wey go later bi di oga for di company, with Mr. Ross, no get anytin to do with dia relationship for di fight against Guber-Peters duo, and dem no get anytin to do with di broda.

Talks between di two sides fit ekele, of course as e don pass one time wen Sony talk sey im wan go hire Oga, Guber, and Oga Peters.

But di two sides appear to be more willing now to meet demsef to settle di matter.

And although Warner don yarn sey e wan make di producers do deir contract, di producers yarn for inside swear court declaration sey dem no fit repair di relationship after di acrime of di legal battle.

Any settlement also wey dem go do na to exclude Mr. Guber, and Mr. Peter from any of di projects wey dem dey do for Warner.

Guber Peters duo get 50 project for different stages of development, and production for Warner including Bonfire of di Vanities, and Bright Shining Lie.

But dat one no mean sey Oga, Guber, and Oga Peters no go fit get hand for some of di tins wey dem dey do, sey studio dey develop hundred movies, but na only 10 to 20 per year.

Once person studio no wan even do film wey dey develop, na im be sey dey free to carry am go oder place.

Oga, Guber, and Oga Peters sef, dem no go fit participate for future sequel to Batman, di blockbuster hit wey dey produce for Warner.

But when Sony get Guber-Peters Entertainment, e go get part of di profits from Batman, because goment dey collect some revenue from movies wey be sey na Oga, Guber, and Oga Peter dey produce.

Di two publishers get combined 28% stake for Guber-Peters.
