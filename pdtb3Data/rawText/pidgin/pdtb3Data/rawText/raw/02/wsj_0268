Many thank Alexander Cockburn comic masterpiece (U.S.

Economy: Affordable House on Junk-Bond Sand, Viewpoint, Oct. 19)

Use of di abominable construction for Soviet Union (wey be sey di collapse of sand apartment block during di Armenian earthquake) as parabol for U.S. economic system na one better example of Mr. Cockburn own.

I dey await im sequel, di economic, social disguishment of San Francisco Bay area, and di wonderful work wey local governments, private charitable organisations dey do dere as metaphors for supremacy of anytin wey failed system Mr. Cockburn now believe.

Sey make e dey shout.
