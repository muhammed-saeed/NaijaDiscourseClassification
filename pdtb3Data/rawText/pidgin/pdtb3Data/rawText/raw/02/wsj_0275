As Georgia-Pacific gofri for Great Northern Nekoosa don show, di way wey una take win, na im de still dey alive even if tori be sey e never happen.

So di debate on top poison go continue to dey vex inside corporate hall and inside hall of academia.

Even though sey poison wey dey inside come get different colour, and shape, usually give current shareholders more stock if some kind ting happen (typically, if hostile bidder acquire am pass di full amount of di corporation stock).

But dis discount wey be sey de dey buy, na normal price wey be sey go give corporation directors if de agree sey person wey dey sell sell go buy.

Supporters of poison go argue sey deir adoption force, deir bider to negotiate with corporation directors, who, deir position dey better dan to pursue long - term matter for di corporation.

One new study wey Georgeson and Co dey do, talk sey na company dem dey take get medicine wey get poizin, wey get poizin, wey get poizin, wey get poizin, wey get poizin.

â€œCritics of poison pills dey argue sey e dey harm shareholder by letting corporate management take over bid, and by giving premium bid wey be sey de dey sell to shareholders.

Plenty academic talk-less of dem dey support sey adoption of poison pills, no be only short run, but also over long period.

Institute investors wey dey do dose dose medicine on a regular basis, dey interested in di general debate on top specific questions wey di corporation dey carry.

Dis kain corporate get high quality management team wey dey do well?

Dis team get a viable strategy to improve shareholder value, and dis strategy na on extension?

Adolo fit take dis particular form of poison, go reduce di chances of management to carry out dis strategy?

If the answer to this question na affirmative, den institutional investors may favourably decide to take one particular poison pill.

But di problem be sey once most of dem don adopt poison, de survive forever.

Although di current management team may be outstanding, who go be di CEO in 10 years?

Even if five years strategy dey favour, wetin go bi di 25 years strategy?

Di solution to dis problem na time limited poison.

Di boundary fit range from three years to seven years depending on di management team and di strategy wey dey dere.

At di end of dis period, dem go just remove di poison instantly unless di new poison wey dey inside di corporation shareholder approve am, wey go get opportunity take check di company strategy, and management team dat time.

One rare case of acute poison wey dem dey call agric, na di shareholder right plan wey dem adopt last year after dem don suffer wella from Tezaco.

Ponziil dey give five years to give current management time wey be sey de go do am wisely.

Anoder interesting one na di poison wey dem dey take recently by Pittsburgh based National Intergroup Inc, one different diversified company wey dey hold di company.

Di State of Wisconsin Investment Board, wey get about 7% of di company voting stock, follow management to devise one time limited poison pill.

Dis pill automatically expire after three years except di vote of di shareholders.

Di attitude of Wisconsin Investment Board na im dey grow deceptive to time limited poison for inside institutional investors akordin to di recent meeting wey di Council of Institutional Investors, and my informal survey of several pension plan wit big stock positions.

More than usual, poison poison go allow shareholders view one particular poison pill within di context of a specific management team strategy.

This kind concrete analysis go fit lead to more fruitful dialogue between management, shareholders den di abstract debate on poison.

Mr. Pozen na di general counsel and managing director of Fidelity Investments for Boston.
