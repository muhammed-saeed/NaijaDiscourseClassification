E no dey clear wheder Eastern will succeed in overturning di arbitrator decision, in long - seated "pay parity" dispute wey presido di chapter 11 petition, and en 1986 acquisition by Texas Air.

All di previous court wey dey inside di USSR, wey dey inside di USSR, don fail.

One Eastern spokesman yarn sey e no expect sey di arbitrator ruling, sey e go get any overall gain for di company strategic plan.

Bankruptcy experts talk sey di law no clear on how dis kind arbitration wey dey go affect company matter.

Dat may leave many leeway for U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Libri, to decide wetin, if anytin, di pilot dey collect.

For August, e come outside di ruling wey allow di pilot pursue deir back pay wey dey grieve before di govnor.

Di pilot contract with Eastern call for an ogbonge ogbonge private arbitrator to resolve such grieving matter.

For one statement to employees, Eastern said di company dey disappointed by di ruling, "Di obligation is absolutely unwarranted", di statement tok.

Eastern creditors committee, plus di company, na im dey always para on top di pilot claim wey if dey pay for di pilot to come out of money, wey be sey de wan carry on top oder bank account matter.

Eastern, and deir debt, na di final stage wey dey negotiation for di second reorganization plan to take over di airline debt.

Anoder plan wey be sey de don suspend di pipol for July, come fall apart when Eastern freedom come change di plan.

E no know wheder di pilot claim follow for di plan.

Di dispute between Eastern and im pilots, na over pay by clause for di pilot contract.

Di clause na for one agreement wey be sey pilots go collect big, big money as long as sey no oda labour group go collect big money.

Shortly after Texas Air enter eastern part of eastern part, some machinist union overseer receive 20% money.

Di pilots argue sey dis one cause pay raise for dem.

Eastern don drag di claim, but one Federal District Court, one appeal court now, di arbitrator don drag di pilot.

Di two sides no even agree on how much be di money now.

Di pilots put di money on top $100 million, di company make am $ 65 million.

Anoder arbitrator dey hear anoder pay parity case between eastern and west pilot resulting from a different set of circumstances involving separate pay raise, and join union.

Di decision on top dat one no be before mid November.

Ironically, many of di pilot wey dey inside don comot for eastern or dem still dey strike di carrier wey bin file for bankruptcy protection March nine.

About eight hundred men don cross finish for the work wey dem first do.
