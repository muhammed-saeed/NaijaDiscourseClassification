:.START

DON HAPPEN photo of the police as e dey drag leg from one building to another for one of the city wey we dey.

Di latest one wey don happen na di pro-... and anti-Albortionists, anti-nucle, animal rights group, university student dem, racism, anti-Apartheid groups, different kain people wey dey do environment, and people wey no happy with di way di war dey go.

Maybe e no start am, but Mohandas Gandhi do indeed give us one visible beginning for civil disobedience as we know today.

Di Mahatma, or di great soul man, instigate different types of passive resistance against British government for India.

Because of wetin Webster's biographical Dictionary talk, e no control imself again and im rule come cause wahala, later e go do another one wey dem dey call riot, and second prison. I no be anytin for rioting, but some of im law wey e dey do na correct one because India dey under one foreign power, and Indian people no dey fit follow am do wetin dem suppose do.

But e dey hard now to justify civil disobedience, non violent, or non citizen wey be sey de don carry hand collect di ballot box to allow am change.

Where truly representative government dey safeguarded by constitutional protection of human right, and independent judiciary to take construe dat right, no get any right to break di law because some, or group dey disagree with am.

E get some kind cases wey be sey di law dey correct, e get some kind right wey person no dey too get and e hard to criticise am.

Wetin happen to Rosa Parks wey be the black woman wey no gree sitdown for back of bus na illustration.

But many times, if yu nor gri obey, e dey bad for God eye.

Public dey get di tendency to equate law demonstration with civil disobedience.

Two pipol nor dey fight each oda, but di tin wey dey between dem, different well-well.

Labour na peaceful demonstration, like peace pickin, and oder assemblage wey no dey disturb peace, or disturb rights of any oda person, na im dey guaranteed by any true true democracy wey government dey give.

Disobedience na bad tin wey dey break di law.

Di matter wey dey di book na about civil disobedience, but before we go do anytin like dat, make I do some kind tins wey go show sey, na law wey dey bring wahala.

E dey useful to call public attention to wetin dey pain, but no value to dey teach anybody wetin dey worry for di matter.

Di delight wey dey for inside di dramatic confrontation dey make many people shout different - different slogans through bull horns, militants, accusation, and oder tactics.

Devil talk, and environment wey compromise fit start to dey lost for inside enemy level because of superficial media interview.

Demons dey use am anyhow and e dey useless. At worst, e fit cause wahala wey dey bring out wahala.

Demons get right to enter thief hand when they leave the site of weeping come dey mobile.

Petty criminals, and street people wey dey like to dey jump up, and down like remors, dem dey use di protest take dey throw stone, dey throw stone, dey shoot, dey break, dey loot, dey carry pocket pick, and general hoolo.

E no tey wey dem do di demonstration for Moab mania.

E get better way to promote cause.

Where no be civil disobedience be di centerpiece, no be law demonstration wey fit only attract crime.

Some people no dey put hand for di way dem dey treat visitors anyhow, dem dey spoil passengers, dem dey block traffic, all di rest.

Dem talk sey dis one na small money to pay for galvanizing action for di major ting.

Di crime fit be small, but di price fit be big.

Two case to illustrate.

Assumpt a neighborhood demonstration to stop speeding on a certain road or a police car wey injure.

Di protesters lie down for road, dey block traffic, and dem no go move until authorities carry dem go.

Assume sey person wey jam jam don enter e heart attack.

No way to get ambulance quick quick to move am go hospital.

E die.

Demontin nor dey fight and na only yeye tins e dey do, but e dey kause wahala and e dey kill well-well.

Assume sey one TV network dey do one celebrity interview wit live audience.

Di politician wey dey appear, dey popular well, well, and recently, e don cause plenty talk with some groups.

For one plan against im appearance, some members of di studio audience chain demsef for front of TV camera so dat di programme no go continue.

Network na to dey pay people wey dey advertise, dem go lose big, big revenue, dem go get big head.

Demons don do no-vessel, but because of deir trespass, e don cause serious wahala for oda people wey deir quarrel.

E fit be sey TV don do more dan deir share to popularize and promote non-violent civil disobedience, so second situation go be like case of chicken wey dey come house to roost, or maybe TV network go lose noting.

Geraldo or maybe e go bring out anoda camera, and interview di protesters.

Make wi look for anoda type of rebellion wey dey kause wahala for oda pipol, but e dey kause wahala for di whole country.

I dey talk about di young men wey do wetin deir country call to carry gun for Vietnam war, come run go for Canada, or for any oda sanctuary make dem no fight.

Di waka wey dem dey do of civil disobedience, wey dem try hide under di vexnashon for war wey dem dey call immoral, wey make national cloth weak, and wey make people suffer for dat katakata.

Even di leaders wey dey lead and support di bad tins wey dey happen, na worse tin dem dey do o! Dem dey do am to help and help dia enemy make dem mind come down.

E dey wonderful sey as dem dey arrange mass execution for Vietnam and Cambodia, e no dey heavy dem for mind as dem dey do am.

Worse, e remain for one long time but na wayo president for United States na im come do di final inference on top di people wey fight and die for Vietnam.

Under di guise of causing di wound of di nation, President Carter come pardon thousands of draft evaders, e come give dignity to deir accusation of di war IMmorality, deir preceding generation wen be sey de bin set up to defend di U.S. yield to di temptation to shield di fight by simply declaring di war immorality, dey hide until di war end.

Finally, I think it is important to point out di extraordinary high visibility of non - compromising civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage.

Give television make dem fit cover pesin wey dey break law, no second invitation.

This one come even ask why dem dey lead people wey dey do demonstration for government o.

De want make spotlight for demsef, or spotlight for demsef?

â€œDis na di good tin wey awa grand-grand papa dem do: If na di tin wey dem dey do make di pesin wey dey lead dem, di pesin wey dey lead dem, big pass di pesin wey dey lead dem.

In either case, ask yoursef wheder you don know on top di matter wen you dey watch as people dey do civil disobedience.

If yu nor fit, e go betta make yu kwayet dey tok well about di matter, bikos e dey gentol and honest.

Mr. Agnew na vice president for U.S. from 1969 until im resign for 1973.
