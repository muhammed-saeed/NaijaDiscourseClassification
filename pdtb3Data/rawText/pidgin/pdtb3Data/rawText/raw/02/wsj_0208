One of Ronald Reagan character as president be sey im no dey too give im blessing to di claptrap wey dey pass for different international institution.

In fact, e liberate di U.S. from one of di world biggest corrupt organisation, UNESCO.

Na di U.N. group manage to translate di own charter of promoting education, science, and culture.

Ever since, di remaining members don dey push for United States make dem join dis dreadful group.

UNESCO apologise don begin dey ginger Presido Buhari on top sey im go comot for Presido.

But we can think of many reasons to stay out for tomorrow, and beyond.

U.S., along with Britain and Singapore, when di anti-Western ideology, financial corruption, leadership struggle come out.

Di personal antics of di agency director, Amadou-Mahta bin drag plenty kobo, like sey some of im top aide bin dey naked as KGB plant and e bin dey come from France, when dem set up one kobo office fire just before Congress send accountants go dey trace U.S. funds.

Mr. M'Bow na one kind extreme case, but even im replacement sef, di more perfect Physicist Federico Mayor sef, e never still achieve any reform.

Di yeye project wey dey continue na im be di New International Economic Order wey be sey redistribution from West to pay for everybody else satat.

Di orwellian, new world information order go give government people right against press, journalists go must kowt down to deir government wey go get licence, and censorship, and even duty to stop printing of "wrong ideas".

UNESCO con even convert di founding U.N., ideals of individual rights and freedom into people right, million dollar conference wey dem do on top different level wey be sey science people dey support disarmament, and how di matter take affect transnational corporations.

Di agency comot from di high standard wey e take start, sotay even Soviets now dey wonder about one agency wey be like sey dem dey congnial.

Glasnost fit dey responsible, but Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, last year admit say, di way di party dey para, dey weak well, well for UNESCO.

UNESCO don dey do im biennial meeting for Paris now to devise im next project.

Mr. Mayor hope say reference to "press freedom" go survive without fault, di current tori na "e dey teach public and media to avoid manipulation", e never fit replace di M'Bow cabal.

"Soviet still dey in charge of education, one former head of one African military tribunal for execution, dey in charge of culture, and one hardline Polish communist for exile, dey direct human right, and peace division.

Of di agency, 2,750 staff, 230 dey go on top actual project like literacy, oceanographic research.

Di position wey United States once get wey don contribute 25% of di budget, na sey noting don change.

John Bolton, wey be di Assistant Secretary for International Organisation, tell Congress sey di ongoing ‘statist, restrictive, nondemocratic ’ program dey join body any time wey be sey e no too dey important, dis one no too dey important for UNESCO delegates, wey last week no even fit raise money by selling one old French chateau wey be di agency own.

Other countries, even West Germany, fit dey hard now make dem still get am.

We see anoda kworel wey we get with UNESCO pass di one wey no gree change.

Dis one na di one wey be sey di Reagan Revolution wey dey for eastern Europe and di tins wey dey happen for eastern Europe, show sey international government, or government functionary, dey push different kain ideas on top different level.

Free market, free mind, and free election dey appeal wey be sey na only through U.N. organization dem take do am, and na most of government people dey suffer am for house.

Babes for United Nations sabi obfuscation.

Dis na wetin e fit do anytime, but e no get any reason why e be like dis. Western concept of freedom, and justice.

We see plenty reason why we dey outside and none dey join UNESCO.
