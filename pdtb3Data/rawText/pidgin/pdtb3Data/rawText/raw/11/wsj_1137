Vote Rights Act of 1965 na im dem do to fulfil di promise wey di Fifteenth Amendment give dem, and e allow Southern African to go polling, without sey dem read am, or any other device wey dey excluded.

After twenty-five years now, di Vote Rights Act, and Justice Department don change to one kind of racial gerrymandering to increase number of black, and oder minor minorities, Hispanics, Asian, and native Americans dey hold electoral office.

For 1980, Justice Department and lower federal court wey dey enforce Voting Rights Act don impose state legislature, municipal government, to create di maximum number of (safe) minority election districts, districts wey minority dey between 65% and 80% of di vote population.

Di programme sef don begin to create "safe" white districts for municipality wey be sey na Oyinbo minority.

Aldough, section 2 of di Act wey dey inside sey minority go win big share of elective office, small, small municipal, and state government plan to get approval by di Justice Department, or survive di scrutiny of lower federal government unless dem carry out as many strong minority districts as possible.

Di new goal of di Vot Rights Act (na im dey important pass for di political office) dey laudable.

For political process to take do, all citizens regardless of who they be, must feel represent.

One essential indicator wey dem be be sey na minority group de dey elect to public office wit reasonable frequency.

As e be so, black na 12% of di population, but less than 2% of elected leaders.

But no be race gerry-... to carry dat important goal come out.

Sey na kukuruku dey o.

To promote commonity between oyibo, oyibo, oyibo, oyibo, oyibo, oyibo, oyibo, oyibo, oyibo, oyibo, oyibo, oyibo, oyibo, oyibo, oyibo, oyibo, oyibo, oyibo.

Such policy implies sey na only black person fit talk for black person, and only white person fit govern for oyibo person.

You fit see am for two city wey be New York, Birmingham Ala, Ala.

When de go recompare deir district after di 1990 census, every oder municipality, and state for di country go face dis issue.

New York City: Racial gerrymandering na one wey don dey happen for New York City since 1970 when Congress first change di Voting Rights Act to expand am reach south states.

For 1972, Justice Department come direct make dem redraw electoral map for Brooklyn borough to concentrate on top black and Hispanic vote despite opposition say new electoral boundary go divide Hasidic Jew people into two different districts.

Dis year, one commission wey di mayor appoint to revise New York government, dem do one new charter, dem add am to 51 from 35 members.

Sometime for 1991, as soon as di 1990 census go start, one redistricting panel go redraw City Council district.

Di Charter Revision Commission don sama o sey because of di expectations wey di Justice Department and di commission get to dey enhance small, small political leadership, di new district go dey go along wit evry oda minority district.

Black and Hispanics currently dey up to 38% of di city population, and na only 25% of di council seats dey.

Some of di city of black leaders including Democratic mayoral candidate, David Dinkins don come out for race gerry to accord black, and Hispanic say di best chance wey dem get to represent.

For dis one wey dey happen so, e good make we no forget sey some members of New York City Council, dey represent different - different areas wey be sey na Black, Hispanic, oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo oyibo o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o

To win deir seat, de must hear all di voice for deir district, and devise public policy wey go benefit all of dem.

Many of dem don find out say di relevant issue no be race, but na housing, crime prevention, education.

Birmingham Ala: Di ogbonge tin wey happen for Birmingham, vividly e show sey di judgement wey dey come out from inside safe districts na for ethnic minority.

For Birmingham wey be 57% black, na di minority minority.

Vote Rights Act, one group of oyibo bring one federal suit for 1987 to demand sey make di city drop at-large vote for di nine member city council and create nine electoral districts plus four safe districts.

Oyinbo sey oyinbo sey oyibo sey oyibo sey oyibo sey na only black candidate, or white candidate wey oyibo dey represent for inside city, na im oyibo fit win.

No federal court don rule say Voting Rights Act dey protect oyibo, but for June, Justice Department, dem don approve one district planning for Birmingham wey bring three white supremacities, six black supremacity districts.

Richard Arrington, Birmingham's black mayor, dey laf di consequences, de say before, people wey dey contest for office, de no fit offend black, or oyibo, e say now you dey district, you go likely get candidate wey deir view na more extreme, white, and black on top racial issue. Two hundred years ago, people wey dey write for United States Constitution, don dey too much and dem don too do different - different economic matter.

Dem talk sey dem no fit use one person wey be farmer take dey do farm matter and person wey be business man take dey do business for seaport.

But James Madison refute dat argument for one of di most important political treat treatin ever, no be 10 of di Federalist Papers.

Madison talk sey di work wey representative dey do, no be to talk wetin small, but na to talk wetin good.

Large, big election districts go encourage good government, Madison say because one person wey be representative go come out, e go come serve all im constituent wey dey im side, and e go serve no one.

Madison na one of the better vision wey the representative see.

As long as we believe sey all Americans, of every race, and ethnic background, de get common mind, and fit live together togeder, make our political map reflect wetin we believe.

Racacial gerrymandering - dem dey create black, and white districts o, dem talk sey we don troway dat belief sey we fit live togeder dey govern oursef as one people.
