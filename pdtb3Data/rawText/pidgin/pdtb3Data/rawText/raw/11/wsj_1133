President Bush dey reason sey e go do one kind vexnashon to determine whether di court go rule say e get dis kind pawa.

Oga Bush don long campaign for passage of one bill, or constitutional amendment wey go give am one line of item veto, wey go allow am carry one item for big bill, and e no go kill all di bill.

E don argue say dis kind presidential power necessary to rein-... in Congress spending.

But some analysts, especially conservative legal scholars, don advise Oga Bush make e no wait for formal authorization, just to assert sey Constitution don already give am power to do line item veto.

That kind statement most likely go bring about one court challenge from congress wey go clarify whether Presido don already get dis kind power.

But e also yarn sey exercise of testimony veto no be on top of di Presido agenda because e dey face more, more budget matter now.
