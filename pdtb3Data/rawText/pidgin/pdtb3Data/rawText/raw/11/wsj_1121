E get one day wey one man dey dig rock wey dem dey koll, “Namib Desert”, wey dey near di Atlantic Ocean.

Men go dey crawl for sand, dey find stone.

E dey eazy to karry ship for Malibu.

Di men still dey use shovel, and handkerchief dey go find dat small worm.

But na only three hundred and thirty-six big shariot wey dey move to De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd, di world kingpin, na dem dey do dia work.

Last year, di total na 43 million pound of desert from one piece of rock to anoda for 934,242 motor wey dey produce 46 tons of sand, or one-fifth gramma.

Oya, na 300 yards dem still push go Atlantic.

If de get diamond dere, we go reach dem,” na so Les Johns, de Beers engineer talk.

E get one hole wey dem dig inside rock wey dem dey call cherubim. The hole dey inside rock and na im dey hold di precious stones wey dey inside di world.

Una sabi polish well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, first for di Orange River wey carry di stones comot for inside South Africa, den cold sea, den for di dry sands of di desert, 98% of di diamond wey una polish na betta tin.

While oder mine go produce more carat, at least di number go put am for industrial use.

Since dis treasure chest too big for person to kukuma, de don turn am to one.

After one railway worker wey im name na Zacharias Lewala, first carry one diamond from di sand for 1908 na im Germany colonialists start to dey fly for di desert wey be sey na about 200 miles from Orange River, and 60 miles from Atlantic, wey be sey military go dey restricted.

When Germany lose World War I, de lose Namibia go South Africa, and diamonds to Ernest Oppenheimer, di patriarch of Anglo American Corp, and De Beers.

“Today, nobody dey enter or komot from di kourtyard, escept De Beers sakrifice.

Di mining zone na also one of di most isolated places for Africa.

Ghost Town dota di Namib dunes, to prove diamonds no dey last.

Oranjemund, my headquarters, na one lonely corporate oasis with 9,000 residents.

For nite, jackals dey waka for di street and jackals wey get long horn. Dem dey waka for desert dey drink wota wey dey bring rain.

For evry generashon, heat and kold wey dey kom out from di sea dey bring kloud wey go kover di sky.

Breeze dey blow komot from pesin body and e nor dey ever stop.

Still, miners from different parts of Namibia, plus professional staff from De Beers head office for South Africa, and London dey come.

And Oranjemund dey boast o, apart from diamond.

De get six video rental, three restaurant, one movie, 34 sports, and recreation club for everyting from cricket to lawn bowling.

Di pride of Oranjemund na di 18 hole wey be sey na im dey drag pass for di world.

Last year, when di rising orange river threaten to swamp di course, di same engineers wey dey push di Atlantic come rush go build wall take hold di flood sey noting dey too good for our golf course. Tony George, one mining engineer.

Despite fear say di new nashon wey be Namibian government after next month election wey dey free country from South Africa, de Beers engineer dey work to extend am productive life for anoda 25 years, from wetin dey now estimate of 10 years.

Dey use machine wey be like sey na from Star Wars desert dem for dey see wood wey dey inside forest.

“Di mechanics dey use di sand wey be sey na big antead wey get ice-blok dey use. Dem dey use dia wheel dey use shuku-shuku, instead of seat. Dem dey use shuku-shuku, instead of seat. Dem dey use shuku-shuku, instead of seat. Dem dey use small-small shit wey dem take dey check wetin dey happen for road.

Di wall wey dem make with iron, long rish six hundred and na so too e tick rish 60 fit.

“Made of sand dey guide against strong breeze for aftanoon.

“Wen di gold wey dey di wall don komplete, e go move go nort.

To sleep with person wey no be your husband or wife, be like person wey dey rust for inside water.

For example, na brick dem use make the wall strong, but the sea trowey am like dry wood.

Na im somebody con decide sey e go try to break down earthmoving equipment wey be sey as e dey so, im hand no dey for water.

Caterpillar people no too happy when dem see deir equipment wey dey use like dat, sha Ruga, dey see sey no be very good advert.

Despite all dis one, most of di diamond still dey inside di sand, di men wey dey use shovel, and cymbals dey find di diamond for inside di sand, wey dem dey call, “bedrock sweeper”, wey dem dey call, “bedrock sweeper".

For blue, and grey overall, de suppose concentrate on top creviation, and not strain deir eye for diamond.

But make de dey spy one, di company go pay di full prize like one out of evry three.

Because dis people wey dey near my pay, dat one, na usually enough to overcome di temptation to thief, criminal wey fit make dem reach 15 years for prison.

But people wey dey work still dey try to squeeze out gem, or two.

One man put many diamond for di bracelet wey e wear.

Anoda one con poke di hole for im shoe.

Food wey e dey chop dey stagga for inside milk pail.

Nobody stop am dey search and e dey look wetin dey my body.
