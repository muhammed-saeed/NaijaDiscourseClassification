If blue blood no go fit pay big money again for racehorses again, who go?

Brothers dey take am do majik.

Di Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association, Lexington, Ky. Based trade group don launch "seminars" for di "potential investors" wey dey di country.

Di group wey don hold half a dozen seminars so far, na im dey reason promotional videos, and maybe na pitch we dey pitch for Wall Street Investment Bankers.

Josh Pons wey be horse breeder from Bel Air, Md talk sey but di real future of dis ball na for inside many people wey be sey de get horse.

For inside Laurel race, di breeders na people wey be sey dem be like Tim Hulings, wey be beer worker.

Oga Hulings now, e dey carry im rider dey waka dey cheer for Karnak on top River Nile, one kaja wey sabi run well, well, dey waka down di house stretch.

Oga Hulings gloats sey e sell all im stock a week before di market pluck 190 point for Oct. 13, and e dey use di money dey buy 45 acre horse farm, just imagine how you go dey happy if na your horse be dat.

But experts talk sey dis one no be game for person wey get weak belle, or wallet, na big risk business o, na Charles C. Mihalek wey be Lexington lawyer, and former Kentucky State securities commissioner o, na you go enter am firmly believe sey na di kind investment wey you go lose everyting.

And many have done just dat.

For example : Spendthrift Farm, one prominent Lexington horse farm wey dem do for 1983, but e do wetin dem dey call bankruptcy court last year.

One group of investors recently buy di remaining asset of Spendthrift, dem dey hope to rebuild am.

Other investors don lose millions of dollars inside partnership wey buy racehorses, bulldozer rights.

One big wahala don happen for inside racerse market.

From 1974 go reach 1984, di best yearling price for di summer time na 918% to di average of $544,681

Since den, na average of $395,374 dis summer.

But na di best horse na im dey sell small, small as $100 for some people wey dey waka well, well.

Even as de dey move outside deir traditional circle, racerse owners still dey try to take advantage of di elan of di sport.

Blossy brochure go circulate for race track gbama about limelight wey di winner circle dey and high society schmoozing.

One handout promise na Pedigree, party, post time, parimutuels, pageantry.

Headley Bell wey be fifth generation horse breeder from Lexington talk sey na just matter of marketing and advertising.

Maybe no be sey e dey simple.

For starter, racers have to remember basic problem of such venture, dis beast no dey come wit warranty.

And for every champion, na plenty nags full am.

Katharin Voss, wey don train before for Laurel, Md., wey dey train now, neophytes na im dey go tour inside horse barn, no be sey na only three of dem dey get am for inside padol.

One brown two years old con dey wheder cold come, anoda con get spit for leg, dey keep animal for run, you can see di high, low, all di business under one roof, she con tell di group sey de no too many winners.

E fit be sey big wahala wey people wey get business dey face, na im dey make newcomers know sey dis one na ogbonge business.

Some bad managed partnership don burn investors sometimes after dem don receive advice from di industry consultants, so owners don develop code of ethics, outlining rules for consultants, and agents, and disclosure of fees, and any clash of interest.

But some people no too dey sure of di code how e go take effect, sey di industry, na on top of individual honesty na im dey yarn sey na one Lexington horse farmer, and one of di investors wey buy Spendthrift na im dey yarn.

Even dough de drop price for person wey dey do well, to get dat one, e no cheap.

At low end, investors fit spend $15,000 or more to get race wey go favour demsef.

For yearling sale now, person fit go solo, go buy horse for small money.

But dat means to repair horse, on average, na $25,000 a year to raise horse.

Dem dey find wetin be sey na small stake di owner dey find, di owner group dey reason sey na special sale di owner go dey sell horse wey be sey na 50% stake di horse go dey sell give newcomers.
