Di talk of sales tax matter, na im come waka come outside inside Congress on top how much Federal Government don dey willing to spend to help for inside California earthquake relief.

Di state bin get about $4.1 billion in relief, but yesterday, di House, dem approve anoda general money wey be sey na $2.85 billion in aid, plus di big one wey be sey na Hurricane Hugo go carry am go regions wey dey affected.

Dat one dey leave di state like $2 billion to $4 billion short.

When we dey pay tax, e be like sey na im dey cheap pass and e no dey hard to raise money quick quick.

According to di state department of finance, one aluminium wey dey increase for di state, six percent per dollar sales, na im go raise three billion.

Willie Brown wey dey lead California Assembly, talk sey Govnor, George Deukmejian don gree sey im go do one special session inside two weeks.

Kaliphonia goment wey dey call Gann limit well, well na im dey stop di state to dey collect new tax, and so drastically limit wetin dey possible for emergency.

Both Mr. Brown, di state most powerful legislator, and Gov. Deukmejiwan increase temporary sales tax, e go be like sey na money wey go pass di state go fit get from di existing source, and federal government.

According by one person wey dey yarn o, governor also dey study wetin fit raise state petrol price.

Oga Brown, meanwhile, e believe sey na only one tax wey go dey possible, and na one penny increase, na im e say Chuck Dalldorf, one aide.

One immediate source of money na emergency fund wey Gov. Deukmejian don set up.

Di fund don reach about $1 billion, and dem dey set up to handle di kind emergency wey state dey face, Tom Beermann wey be di governor Deputy Press Secretary.

But di fund size na disputed by Oga Brown office wey dey estimate di fund from from $630 million to $800 million.

Further, one aide to Oga Brown say government, deukmejian, de don yarn sey e no go spend all di money on top dis one.

To push through a sales tax increase, di state go gats suspend Gann limit citing emergency.

And den, de will be required to reduce tax by a corresponding amount during a three years period after temporary tax increase, according to Cindy Katz, wey be di Assistant Director for State Department of Finance.

When dem dey increase sales, na two times e go be approved for inside state legislature.

But observers dey expect broad support, if emergency and no enough funds from any oder place, I tink sey di attitude go support, na im be di Presido of Calabar Chamber of Commerce.

But odas dey tink sey property owner suppose pay higher dan di state earthquake relief tab.

Since 1970, people wey dey sell things for California dey gain from one tax wey come out from one state wey dem dey call Proposition 13.

Di state fit still increase fuel price, every one penny increase for di tax na $11 million a month.

But na Govnor Deukmejian, and oders dem no dey gree do anyhow to spoil state goment make dem increase fuel price on top permanent basis.

To add to di highway fund, na double of di state govnor plus five years na im go dey on top state matter for June election ballot.

But some fear wey be sey de impose temporary fuel price increase in di meantime, de fit reduce voter support for di matter.

No be sey everybody dey convince di state to raise new revenue to meet di earthquake wey dey happen, but no be probable, sey di state go fit by wit evritin wey don already dey ground, and federal goment go help am. Dem talk sey na Quentin Kopp wey be oga for state senate transportation committee o.

Di claim wey dem file with State Board of Control but go later end for court, na im be di first instance of di collapse of di so called Cypress structure throughduct.

Di men fit win immunisation wey many states dey drag for court because dem dey show sey government people know, or dem suppose know sey di plan of di building don fail and sey dem no fit change anyhow.

One Governing Body talk sey di board never see di claim, dem no gree comment.
