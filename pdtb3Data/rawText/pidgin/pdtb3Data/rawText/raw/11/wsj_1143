For example, na di Krasnoyarsk radar, for November 20, 1984 na im be di first of some 20 journal wey talk sey Krasnoyarsk don break di ABM treaty.

Wheder di installation, weda na early warning, or space track, di lawmakers don yarn sey o, we don judge am sey no be sey we dey break di ABM law for dis time. Di delegation na from New York Times, aides to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, and Rep. Les Aucoin, and Natural Resources Defense Council members. — Washington Post, Sept. 9 1987.

U.S.R. don do one kind ologborangandan inside di building wey dey Krasnoyarsk, plus di one wey dey for di area of Gomel and Moscow, so dat dem go know sey di ABM no do anytin wey dey inside di Soviet Union for 1972. — Eduard Shevardnadze to U.N. Secretary General Perez for Tass, June 10

: -... di construction of dis station na di size of di Egyptian pyramid, I talk am direct, clear violation of ABM. — Eduard Shevardnadze Oct. 23, 1989.

We dey happy sey we don receive confirmation of Krasnoyarsk sey after five years we don dey write about am.

E fit be sey even American apologists go now acquaint demsef.

Without question, someting wey dey interesting dey happen for Politburo policy chamber.

As e dey bid for new agreement, new loan, and indeed admission into government o, Soviet government don recognize am get credibility.

So after 70 years now, e don dey confess o, dey hope sey de go believe on top oder tings.

E no do o.

If Soviet wan believe, de must start to dey tell di truth pass di obvious.

Our own test of ‘glasnost' go be complete international examination of one of di biggest wahala wey dey inside U.S.SRSR, di 1979 anthrax outbreak for one Soviet military facility for Sverdlovk.

U.S. government never waive on top dis incident as na accident for inside biological weapons facility, and hence na violation of di 1972 Biological Weapons Convention.

Pentagon recently release Soviet Military Power, though in general dey adopt softer line, repeated Sverdlovsk assessment.

Dem detail am for inside Congressional testimony dis February, before one explosion for Microbiology and Virology Institute for Sverdlovsk also give anoda deadly sickness wey kill many, many people.

Since Mr. Shevardnadze no address di matter for Supreme Soviet, di Soviet Union oda ting remain sey na tainted meat dey make di Anthrax deaths.

We doubt dis one just as we doubt Oga God, Shevardnadze last year wey Krasnoyarsk no gree join ABM treatin.

And just as we no believe sey di gombodi of lawmakers and arm robbers wey visit Krasnoyarsk, we no too send di donkey to di tainted meat theory by one U.S. team of scientists wey do meeting with Soviet counterparts for Washington last year.

Soviets explain sey di anthrax na one kind of food wey dem dey chop wey come from animal bones. Dem dey chop am for soil wey get worm wey dey creep come out.

Hardvard'S Matthew Meselson wey we dey read don sell something wey be sey di "scientific community" on top di Laotian Hmong sef, in fact di feada of giant bee, in fact di Soviet anthrax scenario dey plausible.

We no believe am.

And true, true, we no believe sey Oga God, Gorbachev, or any of im emissaries, deserve make di West take am as e take talk am.

12Sverdlovsk na big white cloud wey kover glasnost and true true, e dey show sey dem get pawa to control wetin dem dey do.12

: U.S. government Sverdlovsk o, as per Krasnoyarsk no be just political posturing.

Biological weapon don enter inside politics small, small, and true, true, di U.S. government don press well, well o.

But di report wey dey U.S. stand na detail and specific, and di possibility of biological warfare dey strong well, well.

Soviets suppose dey ready now to kick stone wey go allow dem carry out sey Sverdlovsk no gree for di 1972 agreement or, alternative na im go give U.S. people reasonable mind sey dis one na inside bulletin accident.

Until dat one happen, glasnost no fit get di kind credibility wey be sey Oga God, Shevardnadze dey comot for di confession on Monday ah.
