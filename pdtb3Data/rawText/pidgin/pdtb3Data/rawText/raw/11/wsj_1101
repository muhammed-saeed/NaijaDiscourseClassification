Israel don launch new initiative to show di Palestine Liberation Organization sey e still dey do terrorism, and thus to pursue U.S. to break di waka wey dem dey do with di group.

But U.S. officials, de say de no dey buy Israel argument.

Israel counterterrorism officials, dem sama di State Department wit 20-page list of latest terrorist incidents wey dem dey report give di PLO chairman, Yasser Arafat.

Oga Arafat don deny terrorism Dec. 15 wey satisfy di U.S. precondition for direct dialogue wit di PLO.

A U.S. counterterrorism official, na im talk sey experts don dey study Israel list, sey we no get independent evidence wey connect Fatah to any act of terrorism since December fifteen 1988, e dey talk about di specific PLO group wey be sey Oga Arafat head, so far dis list no change our view.

Israel wan end dialogue, but our analyst talk different from deir own.

Oga Carmon yarn sey e also present di list last week give William Brown wey be U.S Ambassador to Israel.

Apart from that one, New York Times yarn sey Israel government don provide im reporter for Jerusalem with different document wey dem talk sey PLO don dey conduct terrorism from Arab territory.

Di state department talk sey e never see copies of di papers.

If dialogue dey base on di assumption sey Arafat, or pilo go stop terrorism, and we get evidence sey continue terrorism, wetin be di logical conclusion? Oga Carmon bin ask.

Israel don tay wey dem claim sey Oga Arafat no suppose to renounce terrorism especially because sey im and im lieutenant dey free to press “armed struggle ” against Jew state.

Now, Jerusalem dey drag ear for di matter as e dey drag ear wit tear-tear tings wey be sey na terrorist act, and plan wey be sey na Oga Arafat.

E dey blame most of dis ones for Fatah.

Di new accusation dey come at a critical moment inside U.S. to bring out talks between Israel people and Palestinian representatives.

Di state department yarn o sey dem don send one new letter on top di matter from Israel Foreign Minister Moshe Arens sey e don dey against Israel before sey make dem go negotiate wit any Palestinian wey dey linked to di PLO.

Deciding wetin dem dey call terrorism fit be legal action.

U.S. dey describe am as "prememe, politically motivated violence, perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational group, or clandestine state agents". To meet U.S. criteria, Israel flagrant incident wey involve civilian, and happen for di pre-1967 borders.

For inside Israel yarn sey na twelve incidents na im happen to Fatah, plus bomb, Molotov cocktails.

But U.S. officials talk sey e no dey satisfy all dese incidents na terrorism because dem fit offshoot of di intifadah, di Palestinian rebellion for di occupied territories wey U.S. no dey classify as terrorism.

In addition, dem talk sey Israel people no show sey na Fatah, or any group of Mr. Arafat na im dey do dis one o.

U.S. terrorism expert also yarn sey dem dey very uncertain on top di two document wey dey leak go New York Times.

Di paper wey Israel talk sey dem don discover for inside Israel wey dey Gaza, na im talk about terrorist act wey dem go do inside name of one group wey dem dey call Revolutionary Eagles.

Some supporters of Israel say U.S. policy on palava on top Palestinian terrorism, na because of intense desire to maintain di dialogue wit di PLO.

But State Department suppose Israel people sey dem dey leak question wey fit make dem embarrass U.S.
