However, on top di very page wey you print one comment wey address one of di biggest gbege wey dey American education system.

Happily, dem bury di comment for anoda article so dat e no go dey for education context.

For inside di management journal, Atsushi Kageyama dey comment on top many quarrel between America and Japan culture, e bin yarn sey, Japan dey born for way wey many Americans go suffer well, well.

After one kind, serious childhood now, as de dey enter school, na stiff correction de dey give dem.

Wetin many people wey dey worry about school matter, weda na to understand am or to forget am, na im be sey America children for di whole world, na im plenty pass for the world, dem dey do any attempt to improve wetin dey happen for education wey fit lead to failure.

If parents, and teachers alike begin to dey take more correction for children, all di right thing, talk, and action no go fit solve di problem.
