Japan don climb from World War II ashes, one gross national product of about $800 per capita to reach di heavyweight class for di world.

Now dis remarkable economic growth e be like sey e don dey end because government never convert itself to modern, modern, modern, developed nation mode.

Till 1980, when Japan join di 10,000 per capita GNP club for advanced countries, na im be example of developing nation.

Government don build port, bridge, highway, school, hospital, and railway.

When di industry weak, e protect dem.

E give Japan people one value, base on sey di country no get natural resources, de must do hard work to create value, through export, and buy food money wit di surplus.

Everybody go get im own better thing.

Dat system don work.

Di standard of living don dey increase for di past 40 years, more than 90% of di people dey consider demselves middle class.

Di people don sama deir leadership, di only credible political party, di Liberal Democratic Party, e clear, and uninterrupted power for those 40 years.

LDP win by landslide for di last election wey hold for July 1986.

But less dan two years, di LDP begin dey weak, and di gap between di two groups dey strong well, well.

Di symptoms na one tin, Japan no get modern government.

Di government still wan sit down for driver seat, set speed, step on top of gas, apply brake, and steer, plus 120 million people for back seat.

Today, government dey do wetin dem fit do to make sure sey dem sabi wetin dem suppose do and make sure sey dem sabi wetin dem suppose do.

E still dey allow people buy the better and the correct thing wey dey everywhere for this world.

Japan government no dey allow dis one.

Di Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery, na ministry of farmers, and, no be provision of provision.

Di Ministry of Health and Welfare na ministry of doctors, and pharmaceutical company instead of organization wey go protect di health of people.

Ministry of Education no be anytin escept a cartel for licensed teachers, and certainly no be for students.

Di Ministry of Construction spread spread go di country, and di international conference wey Japan dey paved for one capita, na im dey di longest for di world, but dem no dey too think of di poor commuter wey dey use so much time dey sit down for traffic.

Ministry of Transportation na di industry, no be di passengers wey de must pay big money.

And di Ministry of Foreign Affairs dey on its own, dey support Japan diplomats wey dey sprinkle plenty money evriwhere to make sure sey deir seat for di dinner table next to di host own.

Dis ministry never do anytin to correct misunderstanding, and misperception wey dey for di root of Japan image.

Instead, e be like sey na foreign pressure, and even trade quarrel na im e dey use take dey do more and more ministry matter.

All dis one show sey Japan ministry still get wetin dey provide mentality, dem no dey serve people, and especially consumers.

De dey serve di industry, and special interest groups.

Di rest of di world follow dis method when Japan come dey develop.

Japan enjoy am because government don give us job wey we dey do, wey we dey grow paycheck.

Japan no be political country.

Na bureaucratic country.

The Diet get only small work wey im dey do compared to the power wey im dey do for office.

Most billboards dey drafted by bureaucrats, no be politicians dey drafted.

Di Diet no dey even drag bill even sometimes because opposition party dem dey always oppose wetin dem dey do sey na waste of time.

So most bill, dey pass without any discussion, especially if na opposition party dey pass am.

A recent example na di 3% consumption tax on top all commercial activity.

Dat one dey make sense for Japan wey be sey dem dey pay tax wey pass 70% of wetin dey happen and wey dey affect direct tax.

If you be salaried, Amen!

If na person wey dey sell, buy, buy, buy 30 percent, and farmer, buy 30 percent.

To correct dis inequality, most people for don prefer indirect tax like di consumption tax.

Dem pass di law for di Breast Plate, bikos di pipol wey dey der, nor dey gri shange.

Na im make Japan people no know wen dem go start to dey introduce di new law for April 1.

Dem tire for di queue wey dey for di cashier, and small coins wey dey change.

All dis tins happen kwik-kwik, so dem kon dey sell pass 100 or 200 koins again.

Dem bi 103, or 206.

Many pipol kamp skata with oneyen coins.

While people dey jing deir change, scandal catch di LDP politicians.

Money like Recruit donations, and women like di one wey Prime Minister Sosuke Uno, and Secretary General Tokuo Yamashita, na im don cause political gbege for Japan.

Where most men dey get hot temper for di sex matter (though dem dey vex for Recruit), women dey vex for each oda, and di poll dey strong well, well.

For new Upper House, and Tokyo metropolitan election wey Socialist Party win, 60% of all women vote, as opposed to di usual 40%.

E dey hard to even analyze how much of dem vex due to Recruit, sex scandal, or oneyen coins for deir purse, but de bin dey vote to punish di LDP.

Ehn by surprise, Socialist Party dey kpako, dey change doctrine.

E don dey okay to face di U.S., but no be Soviet Union.

Nuclear power plant dey acceptable.

U.S. Japan Security Treaty fit continue some kind.

And so on.

Now is the time to reform government from a provider, developing country vanguard role to dat of a modern, modern, industrial nation wey consumers have di ultimate choice.

If di LDP now, as e take compose, e no fit do di transformation, den e go con divide into two parties.

One party fit stand for consumers matter, small government, free trade, globalism to put Japan matter for di best developed, and open country dem.

Di oder party fit continue on top traditional level of di LDP wey dey representate big government, goment, goment, goment, and security.

Di LDP must decide immediately, Lower House must take place before June.

For di present way wey Japanese people, journalists, even some industrialists dey carry power give socialists, e go good for di LDP, to cleanse di old sins.

But make we no forget, dat kind small political experiment fit cause shock for di whole state, and financial market.

Most na only nine months before di LDP fuse go burn.

Oga Ohmae dey manage di Mcinsey & Co for Japan.
