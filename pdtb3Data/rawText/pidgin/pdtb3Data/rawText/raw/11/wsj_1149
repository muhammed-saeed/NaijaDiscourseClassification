Justice Department dey inside deir hand to get pawa on top one law wey federal judge, David Sentelle just recently call am “monster”, wey be sey e dey yarn o sey e dey yarn about RICO.

With di new way wey dey for RICO, Justice e clear sey di law now get too many favour wey person fit use take do bad ting.

Dem print di text of di new policy guidelines from criminal division o.

Dem dey strongly suggest sey justice dey for di side of Drexel Burnham Lambert, Michael Milken, Princeton/Newport.

Justice wan avoid replay of dis tactics.

Dis one na anoda big reexamination of di tenure of New York mayoral candidate, and before U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, wey like to dey gader scalp pass understanding market.

Di new guidelines on top of di confiscation of assets of pipol wey dey tief, investors, clients, bankers, and oders.

Dis one dey follow new guidelines from tax division wey dey stop anybody wey dey call Princeton, newport-... like tax matter from masquerade as RICO case.

Di forfeiture memo na yanga for di press sake sake of sey pre-trial freezing of assets na yanga for di seizure of property without due process, e tell prosecutors make dem no seek forfeiture, if na "less intrusion" alternative e be, and any case wey no concern di defendant crime na disproportionate.

Dis one come a long time ago for Princeton, Newport, di first cryptoed securities firm.

Dem force am enter liquidation before court wen investors don take deir money after government talk sey big mortgage wey dem dey sell, dem go collect am.

Princesses, newport investors, even McKinsey & Co, and Harvard endowment, dem do am to take deir money, because di firm, di liquidation go first judge am, after dem don judge am.

Prosecutors want $23.8 million injunction on top alleged tax fraud of about $400,000.

Di experience of Princeton/Newport, and im introduction to oder ICO-forfeiture case against legitimate business, tell Drexel sey one RICOed investment bank go be ex-investment bank.

Drexel con gree, con gree, con do one arrangement wey allow am carry di matter go appeal on top charge wey di company no fit drag on top of RICO, part of Drexel plea na to cut Mr. Milken liar.

So after all di judgement, nobody don establish wetin, if anytin, Drexel do wrong.

So dat two cheering for di new rule.

Justice don finally recognize im workers abuse, thanks mostly to di demands for reform by former U.S. attorney for Washington, Joseph diGenova, wey wan salvage RICO for real criminals.

But prosecutorial guidelines dey effective only if person wey be Justice, e ready, and e fit supervise vigorant prosecutors.

Judge Sentelle, wey dey di appeal court for Washington for United States, con make dis one for one remarkable speech wey be sey na government of laws not of men, and yet RICO defenders tell us sey make we rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect di overbread of RICO case, e observe, or unobservable, limit civil RICO case by plaintiffs.

What now for Princeton, Newport, Drexel, and Mr. Milken?

Justice should review all dese cases to see what oda case of prosecutor abuse may be.

We suspect sey sometime go gree sey na only di complete repeal of RICO go fit stop injustice in its name.
