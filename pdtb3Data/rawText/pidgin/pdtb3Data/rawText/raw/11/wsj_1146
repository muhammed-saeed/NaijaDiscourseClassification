:.START

Polish rat go chop well, well dis winter.

Farm wey don rotten, barley and wheat go full evriwhere for di land, as many farmers dey run leave di farmers.

Many piglet no go born result, and many hammers no go ever hang for a tailor shop.

But with inflation, korn wey dey grow for farm, e go dey save pass any oda money for di bank.

(As e talk before, na so e still be today ).

Until im labour go produce profit for dis dying, and corruption, even Solidarity government sef no go win am.

For coming months, emergency food aid wey dey come from West, na im go dey shut up for one market wey meat no dey, and new political calamity go dey.

Factory workers on top of strike don cut off Poland oga last year, dis year, na farmers na im bring dem down.

Farmer wey dey sell meat, milk and corn dey wait make government reduce money wey dem dey sell give farmers.

Communist froze price o.

Farmers con do boycott, and meat con disappear for shop.

For Aug. 1, di state go get law wey dey kontrol how dem go take buy food.

When oil no dey, inflation come high.

Dat was when di taa old Peasants party, dey try to dey live through di crisis, join join hand with Communist party, join hand with solidarity for di first liberation of di East Bloc.

But by di time wey Solidarity take office for September, di damage don do, shortfall as economist don come to call am, e don go ya.

Pig dey cost well-well before dem sell am.

Farmer no vex.

De still dey.

When day break, hundreds of una dey travel go di private market for Radzymin, one town wey no far from Warsaw, dem dey carry pig, cattle and sack of food wey government officials no fit force sell.

Na higher price de dey find so.

For inside one truck and horse wey dey for trobol field, Andrzej Latowski na im kpako, e carry heavy hog enter inside one private part of a private part of a private part of aat. E say oya to sell private, na im e dey sell oyibo.

Young farmer dey make money on top small hog wey im dey sell for here.

E no go tay because im old state source of rye, and potatoes don dey dry, e say feed no dey, e say you no fit buy anything now.

I no know why.

Adward Chojnowski dey do.

Dem park im truck for one side wey dem dey sell for market.

Like di oder ones, rye, wheat, and oat full inside sack wey label am ‘Asbestos.’

Made in U.S.R., di farmer for di next truck, con dey shout sey wota, e go fine, e no go cheap, we go sell direct, we go carry heavy, heavy, karry koboko, de go carry small, small klot.

Country people dey breed pig, na Oga Chojnowski dey carry heavy load say dem no fit buy food for state.

E no do o.

Some state middle men dey come dey buy from me.

I dey sell small.

I dey wait.

I get more for my house.

Dis morning, e no dey sell much ting in Radzymin.

When de close time, farmers go come out most of wetin de carry.

A private market like dis no be big enough to take absorb all dat business.

Hulk of Stalinism, e be like sey e no go soon crumble.

State monopoly go continue to dey sell, free, or not until anoder ting take replace am.

Local farm go need to get one private network of procurement, processing, distribution plus one new manufacturing company to supply am wit tractor, pesticide, fertilizer, feed.

Communist do 40 years to see sey no such capitalism ever dey happen for here.

To build am now, na from West Africa im go take build am and na di work wey Solidarity never start.

But Polish farm now get one big asset already, private farmer.

E say na real entrepreneurs we dey deal with, Antoni Leopold, one economist wey dey advise Rural Solidarity, di union countryside offshoot sey many of dem, and dem get property.

Before dis time, Communist party for Britain dey use force deceive collectiviivizers.

Among di Communist reformers now, dem bi tins wey dey make pipol jealous.

Food na di main priority for di reform, di key to popular support.

Chinese don show, Soviet dey learn, family farm dey thrive wey collective fail dey.

Wonnership, e be like sey na di best fertilizer.

Poles don do am too.

Pole get 2.7 million private farm, e dey cover 76% of di arable land.

Dat quarter of di country, na 39 million people dey produce three quarter of di korn, beef, egg, milk, and nine out of evry ten ten tin wey e produce, vegetables, and potatoes.

Like di Roman Catholic Church, di Polish peasant na sign of di nation.

Try as dem fit, Communists no fit replace am, no fit stop am.

And de try.

E get one road wey dem dey pass go Radzymin, one road wey dirty full and e dey lead to Zalubice, one village wey dem dey stay.

Czeslaw Pyszkiewicz get 30 acres for 14 small shit.

E dey produce rye, and potatoes for some hen, five melu, 25 pig.

Dem wear one patched klot and one torin shoe. Dem stand near each oda dey look di ground with ordinary eye.

Na bad soil e dey talk.

Till 1963, na good soil.

Di state con put reservoir wey go supply di area water.

Farmer dey for front of di bulldozers.

Dem no gree hear dia komplain.

Di dam cause wota to stop for Zalubice.

Mr Pyszkiew si as e dey smile and e dey vex for im head.

Im expect am well, well.

For im lifetime, di Communists bring light for im village, come pipe im wota wey come out from di reservoir.

No phone.

No gas, we wan make dem build road for here, e say de start, con leave am. One tractor, im only mechanized, e stand for di pigsty front.

Good for noting.

Parts na tragedy.

Even if I get money well, well, I no fit buy wetin I need.

Farmer fit say di same for charcoal, cement, saw blade.

For Poland, na only 4% investment dey take do tins wey farmers want, for West, na 20% increase.

Some big state farm, de go first crack wetin dey grow.

Dem dey use 60 to fertilizer per acre, times two of di high feed.

But deir best ting be sey de dey produce 32% of Polish pork.

I don hear from my friends sey state farm na subsidized, Oga Pyszkiewicz talk sey as im wife, Wieslawa, dey do chair for sun, we get one near here.

Di tin too many for us to tink.

Private farmer no dey waste anyting.

Di state resign peasant to subsidize farm pass 30 years now.

But e no stop to dey push am.

Before, before now, farmer wey no get eh land go collect im pension.

Di pension size still depend on how much wey e dey sell state.

Im goment too do am till di state no fit hold dat bargain.

But only di state dey sell seed, and machine.

Wen food nor plenty, na only milk or korn e dey give pipol.

One private farmer for Poland fit buy land, hire am, decide wetin go grow, wetin go grow.

: E dey free to invest chicken, and to fail for lack of chicken wire.

Dem get plenty freedom, but no be wetin dem fit choose.

I dey my own land, Oga Pyszkiewicz talk sey I no dey hear wetin person dey tell me sey make I do.

Sometimes im wife say we dey happy for dat one.

By staring di peasant, Communists don star Poland.

Villagers like Zalubice dey for one poor school, and few doctor dey dere.

Farm income na 15%.

Di young leave, especially girls wey go carry milk melon for hand.

Some men dey stay, deir best friend get vodka, but two million acres don go.

Without machine, correct farm no go fit grow.

So di potato crop, once di size of forty million, na down to 35 million.

Measest consumption na 1979 level, pork production na 1973 level, milk production na 1960 level.

If food crisis come join di Communist government, food revolution go bring solidarity.

“Di potential dey show for evriwhere for di road wey dem dey pass enter Warsaw. E dey show for evriwhere for di world; e dey spread go evriwhere for di world; e dey spread go evriwhere for di world and e dey show for evriwhere for di world.

Dem dey do agriment, dey do agriment, dey do agriment, dey do agriment, dey do agriment, di pickle, sauerkraut sublime, di state monopoly long, long.

Granin, milk, and meat next.

Di private matter wey dem dey do for tractor na to dey find money pass Poland own, but smokehouse or local milk milk go quick dey come out.

Poles no dey make anytin wey dem plant on dat scale.

12Soliday want am from west.12

Maria Stolzman wey be one of di farmers, na im dey yarn di one on top di line sey: ‘Di World Bank go enter inside us to help us destroy di old system.

Felis Siemienas don dey kill am now.

E dey pack pig.

For January, dem write law to allow am smoke meat wey still get blood and e must nor get pig.

Cashed in.

Poland na short one for enterprises, no be for enterprises.

I dey pay farmer well, well, and five times state salary to my workers, na im e dey talk.

E dey for Warsaw to open shop, I dey hire transport, and my customers dey catch cold every day.

I no dey subsidize anybody.

Everybody wey dey around me, im dey live well.

Ehen my price high.

If nobody buy, I go bring price down.

Na di rule be dat.

Na market be dat.

Mr. Siemienas dey make fortune ten thousand every month.

E don buy some fine western clothes, and one green Mercedes with one American flag for di window.

But di meat machine wey e carry na 50 years I no wan buy expensive machine o.

If di situation change, I go hook up wit dem.

Na politics be dat.

APOSTLE PAUL, wey be one time Communist waka, Solidarity don pursue pikin wey be rural entrepreneur.

Local Solidarity object, not to avail, when Solidarity leader, Lech Walesa gree support di Peasants.

E object again for September wen Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiuki no gree call am peasant party to be im agriculture minister.

Both peasants and Rural Solidarity dey form new political parties for farmers.

Peasants fit cause credible kase against Solidarity, sey hell-bent reform go drive millions comot for di land.

Next spring, two of dem go battle local election.

But till den, and maybe afta some time, Communist go just block block, from di head of di milk cow go reach village bank manager, dem go plant am for Poland village.

We know how to get from capitalism to socialism, Sergius Znicippouk dey yarn one afternoon sey we no know how to get from socialism to capitalism, im farm 12 acres for Grabowiec, two miles from di Soviet border for one of di poorest places.

Now e dey climb steps of one stukco building for one nearby village on a visit to di Communist administrator di naczelnik.

Many people for Poland dey hope sey dis government go break down, Oga God, wey be local council, and rural solidarity, na im di naczelapo dey count on.

Na im be our enemy pass.

Everytime im dey see me, im dey very nervous.

Farmer dey enter inside naczelnik office.

Thief wey dey wear long black suit dey look one newspaper.

Mr. Untilerson na im dey sit down.

Anatol Pawlowski leg start to dey jibit under im desk.

Sey solidarity no dey favour di good wey dey dis region after some kind sweet taste, sey de wan turn everyting upside down in a week.

Mr. Untilerson here wan use 60 acres now for state farm.

E no fit guarantee sey e go fit use am any better.

I dey ready at any moment to contest state farm.

Di naczelnik avert im eye, wetin you get?

No be even tractor sef.

And you wan do wicker basket too.

I fit do five tins once o to be business man.

Big business, Oga Pawlowski snorts for English.

Farmer dey go.

naczelnik stand sef.

I take care of dis post well, well e say eight years don pass.

De don build one cultural centre, shop.

Suddenly, I no dey comfortable for Solidarity.

I don do big, big work.

De wan do anoder one o.

Farmer go comot.

So di naczelnik kon lock en door.
