Ehn people know sey federal government don borrow almost like dat money as e take borrow.

From 1980 to 1988, when federal budget na $141 trillion, government na im don issue three billion new direct, plus 756 billion new primary loan.

Dis figures dey promise secondary, dey deposit insurance, and dey do government ponishment enterprises (big wahala o, e dey inside dis page May 3)...

Local credit programme dey date back to di New Deal and dem suppose to break even money sef.

Since 1950, federal lending don experience extraordinary growth in credit volume, subsidy rate, policy application, spur spur on top government increase in general, and budget gimmick, and deceptive management in particular.

As we go see, many of dis obligation no dey show for federal deficit.

But recent one wey don happen show sey federal credit don dey get head.

Student loan default na about 12%, and di programme don rocked by allegations of fraud, and mismanagement.

Fadermers Home Administration (FmHA) loan don turn to deir giveaway program, over di next three years, de suppose to overrun $20 billion.

Di default on Veterans Affairs loan na double for di last eight years.

Last month, General Accounting Office yarn sey di default wey dey for Federal Housing Administration, na five times wey dem dey compare am to before and sey na FIHA equity fall to minus $2.9 billion.

GAO talk sey dis one wey dey happen so, sey deir report na one of di biggest, big, big thing wey dey happen now, sey de don do about three hundred billion in top of wetin dey inside deir deposit.

Other credit, subsidy, agriculture, small business, exporting, defense, energy, transportation, oder tings no dey show, but no get shape.

If di programme continue deir own, di potential government dem dey staggering, Federal Government dey hold $222 billion for di direct, and back anoda $550 billion for primary natural guarantee. (second highest lender, na di pool of fha-... and va-... loan wey di agency wey dey call Ginnie Mae, don increase to three three billion).

Although external events don contribute to di morase, di principal cause of di current crisis na internal and informal to all programmes.

To reduce risk, but maintain di legitimate benefit wey dis programme fit provide, credit policy must

1

Use credit take improve capital market, no be to subsidise subsidy.

There is a fundamental difference between providing subsidy, and maintaining integrity of credit.

If di programme na to provide subsidy, dey collect di money, de win di original goal.

So subsidized loans, e dey turn to giveaway, with increase of subsidy, and default rate on time.

To avoid dis wahala, make government only if e wan use every legal method take collect.

Contrast, credit programme fit be correct instrument to take improve capital market matter.

For example, when we dey enter court matter on top interstate banking, one day, credit no come dey again for di agricultural sector.

Wetin help dem na to dey borrow money to solve dis problem well, well.

But dis one no mean sey di big government subsidy, and loss of such loan, na im dey add.

Redit policy suppose separate dis two competing objectives, and eliminate anyting wey provide subsidy.

For example, student loan now, e dey try to subsidize university admission, and mitigate wahala wey be sey deir future earnings no be amebo.

Sey di programme dey give highly subsidized loans to any student wey im family dey collect less dan one penny.

High default rate, low inflation, and government coverage of all intrest wey student dey do for school, dem dey pay am very high.

Family wey no need di loan, na im dey put di loan for bank, dey pay am back when di student don do.

But dis one wey be student loan wey be sey na only to correct correct capital market mistake go allow any student, regardless of im money, for market, or near market.

When di student dey school, intrest wey de dey teach, de go either pay am, add money join.

Dis programme wit cash grant wey needy students go reduce programme, and much more to di intended beneficiaries, e go reduce well, well.

Do better tings.

Give di structure of most credit, e dey surprise sey default rate no dey even higher.

Guarante rate is usually 100%, giving lenders small reason to screen customers carefully.

Di rate wey dey go down small (say to 75), go still provide big, big assistance to di people wey dey borrow.

But e go still encourage lenders to choose more customer wey get credit, and go try well, well make di thing no dey happen again.

For example, Small Business Administration don do reasonable thing to reduce guarantee rate, and default rate inside di Preferred Lenders programme.

Borrowers dey get di same reward.

Since government don disqualify bad debt, di money wey person wey dey owe, na usually low.

Also, e dey common with us to get new government loan even if we never pay am.

Diimple policy in dis case na to improve payment of di glove wey dey come from contracted collection agency, and to deny new credit to defaulters.

Dis provision go hard for one programme wey be sey na to provide subsidy, but for program wey be sey na to compensate na im dey push am.

Record di true cost of credit wey dey Federal Budget.

As per di money wey dey inside di budget, dem dey treat new $1 direct, even dough sey na at least part of di money go come back.

Loan guarantee no be deir own until di borrower default, so new guarantee no dey increase deficit even dough dey create future liabilities for government.

If government change expenditure, or borrow money to guarantee, na so government go still dey flow resources, and e go reduce wetin dey current.

Preparable, exclusive don increase by $130 billion since 1985, direct loan wey be $30 billion don fall by 30 billion.

If na true sey you dey buy credit, subsidy na di money wey you dey buy net, na im you dey sell give government.

Dis figure fit be estimated by using private lender to forecast loss, or by selling mortgage to private owners without federal guarantee.

Di technique no dey perfect, but di two better pass di current system wey dey change di money wey dey buy new credit, akordin to how much be akordin to how much be akordin to di yearly budget of di Congressional Budget Office.

A budget wey dey real, e go reduce money to convert, or borrow money to guarantee, and e go allow taxpayers know wetin Congress dey owe dem.

Dey do standard accounting, and administrative procedures.

Local accounting na one kind of federal credit.

Many banks dey roll over deir debt, dey pay di zinzinzin, dey collect new loan, or dey convert defaulted loan into direct loan.

Anyhow e be, dem no dey ever write di loan.

Some agencies just dey keep bad loan on di books, till di late 1987 wey be di Export Import Bank hold for di portfolio on top di money wey dem dey carry give Cuba for 1950.

More seriously, na im FIMA don carry several billion hey o for di defaulted loan.

Until GAO'S new audit, for 15 years, dem never do full audit finish.

Di administration of federal credit, e go closely parallel wetin be sey na development of loan reserve, and regular audit audit.

"Establishing dis practices will allow earlier identification of emerging financial crises, provide adequate information for loan sales, budget, and reduce fraud.

Government lending no be how we go take obfuscate spending figures, hidden jibiti activity, or big subsidy.

Di reform wey dey ground now go bring new koko, but koko, better koko, and finally, better koko for government as e dey owe.

Without dat kind reform, credit go continue to be huge, high risk proposition for taxpayers.
