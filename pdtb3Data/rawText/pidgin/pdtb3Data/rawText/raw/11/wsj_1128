Soichiro Honda picture don dey hang wit Henry Ford for U.S. Automotive Hall, and di ball wey dey show di name of Jeopardy, na Sony own.

But no matter how we spend for under our skin, we go still get mama, and apple pie.

Second thought, make dat one just mama.

One Japanese apple wey dem dey call Fuji, dey enter orchards di way wey Honda take enter U.S. road.

By 1995, dem go plant am pass any oda apple tree, according to one new survey wey Washington State University, wey be horticulturturturist Robert Norton, talk.

Some fruit visionary say di Fuji fit someday tumble di Red Delicious from top of America apple heap.

E no go carry am for body o.

Di size of di Red Delicious, di apple pulchitude, di Fuji, na im be sey na im small pass, e no get shape, e get greenish, e get things wey be red.

If to say most U.S. grower talk am, we go still dey Paradise if to say snake talk to Eve.

But di tin sweet well-well.

Dat one get sugar pass any apple wey we don test, na University of Massachusetts pomegranate, or apple scholar.

E get long shelf life, and doesn't fool public, na so Grady Auvil, one Orondo, Wash, grower wey dey plant fawol, dey spread di good word about dem, e no dey sweet for outside when e dey chop inside.

Oga God, wey sharp like razor, na 83 years e take buy apple and na for 65 years e dey chop.

Dem know am as U.S. grand-grand papa. E get one apple tree wey resemble each oda and e get di same sense wey e get before.

E shake di apple tree to groun.

Now, even more radical change, e be like sey di grand old maverick of American apple don dey play di role of Hiroshi apple wey be sey e go be No. 1 to replace di Red Delicious.

Di sweet hegemony no go end anytime soon.

New apple go dey grow small, small, di Red Delicious go almost enter belle like mama.

Di tree rut na patriotic tree and di first tree wey dey inside one orchard for Peru, wey dey Iowa, na im dem go first see for 1872.

Wi don dey si am for more dan 50 years naw.

Better apple fit even dey sweet.

E plenty pass times two as e plenty reach di Golden Age, America No. 2 apple.

But di apple industry don ripe for change, red Delicious don enter plane, and di price of production don reduce. Washington State, Oga Norton don yarn.

Dis na di scarcity wey dey on top Alar, one growth regulator wey dey make apple red, crunchier o, but fit be sey e dey affect people wey dey buy and sell, even though sey e no too affect McIntosh.

Di glut, and subsequent low prices, plus cancer fear, na big blow for growers, dem say many of dem no go dey around for some years o, but dem don stop to dey use Alar.

One may be William Broderick, Sterling, Massa, grower, e say dis one na correct ting, e dey look big box of just pomegranate red Delicious near im barn, but I go lose fifty to $60,000 on it.

I go gats go find anoder job dis year just to chop.

Just as dem dey sell tins give oda pipol, na so too dem dey sell tins give oda pipol.

Some na five hundred ant and 150 sickness wey fit kill pesin. Dem dey chop and drink anyhow wey grow for growin. Some na maggot, vulture, mildew, worm, black rotin and bore-rot.

Even if grower beat dem back, im $2,000 rent bee fit dey run comot for neighbour neighbour neighbour neighbour orchard instead of to dey pollute im, Oga Broderick talk.

Though growin no dey fit keep di worm wey dey inside apple, dem fit protect demsef against di price of any one wey different from di one wey be sey dey market like di one wey be sey dey market like di one wey be sey dey market like di one wey be sey dey market like di one wey be sey dey market like di one wey be sey dey market like di one wey be sey na big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,

Na Waltana e con dey shout dey pick one from one tree.

De go bite am, scowl go throw am down, na real dog.

Supermarkets dey enter di variety act o.

De still dey buy apple mostly for big, big red, na im make plenty, plenty taste like woodchucks punching bag.

But freshness pass as e bi before, and e get where de for expand shelf, but tastier, and sometimes pricier, apples say instead of to sell 39 percent a-... a-... a-... Fujis, maybe we fit sell 79 percent a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-... fa-

Di Fuji na one sharp, sharp Japanese pomegranate engineering wey don pass 50 years for government research orchard.

Japan people don do many kind of chinese colour, e get taste, and shelf life.

Naw, di pipol wey fine pass among dem, dey respet each oda well-well, bikos gold dey always dey good for body.

For di cornucopia of go-... go-... go-... Fuji go-... go-... go-... for di past 15 years, e don dey go from almost zilch to some 50% of Japan market.

David Lane, one scientist for Canada horticulture research centre for Summerland, British Columbia, and so apples dey plenty for dere dan big food commodity.

U.S. Department of Agriculture say dis year America go chop about 40% of fresh apples per capita pass Japan.

Fuji, na small potato wey dey U.S., de dey sell mostly for fruit boutique.

But for California, Craig Ito, wey be Fujiapple grower, e say e get Fujiapple cult.

Once person chop one, hook dey hook.

Oga Auvil wey be Washington grower talk sey e fit sell Fujis to Taiwan buyers for $40 a box if e get am (Taiwan be big importer of Fujis from oder places), but im first crop no go dey again till next year, na im go dey see di demand for di next 10 to 15 years na im e go dey sell for di next 10 to 15 years.

Ashington Red Delicious, by di way, e dey run for less dan $10 a box these days.

Oga Auvil see Fujis in part as e dey strike di perversion of U.S. apples wey dey sell for market.

Man dey sidown for office dey decide wetin you go chop.

After all, till 1950, even di Red Delicious na firm, delectable morsel.

Den, as grower con dey buy more, more, more dan sey de wan buy more, more dan sey de wan buy more, more dan sey de wan buy more, more dan sey de wan buy more.

Now di red apple wey de dey sell for summer, na fruitbowl wey fine, but usually, e no good to eat.

But we suppose respect dem (wey be sey dem don almost reach one year), maybe na about 106 years for human being.

Fuji, to be sure sey e don blemish.

Di fruit wey ripe later pass, na im dey grow pass for inside U.S. area wey cold well, well.

Further, di French go compete with more dolledup Delicious ah.

Oga Broderick wey be Massachusetts grower, na im talk sey di big oga for one supermarket even reject im Red Delicious o, sey e never wax, e never brush brush to shine.

And e never dey use hormone wey many people dey use take make apple wey sweet for ear well, well.

Still, Oga Auvil point, Grannies begin trend o, e no get big, big, red one, why e be like dis Fujis?

E see shift in America, at least regarding apple, towards more intensity, and less glitz, e don finally reach di fore.

Or, for dat matter, core.
