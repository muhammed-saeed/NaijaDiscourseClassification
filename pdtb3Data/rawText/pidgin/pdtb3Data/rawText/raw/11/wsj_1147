By alopsided 40118 margin, di chamber reject one attempt to waive Gramm-Rudman for addressing di two disaster, and budget analyst say di increase appropriation go go up by at least $144 billion unless lawmakers increase am or new revenue.

Di budget impact go plenty again for fiscal 1991, and di issue go lead to confrontation between di Appropriations Committee leadership, and budget committee chairman, Leon Panetta, wey be Bayelsa State for inside di earthquake wey happen last week.

When e dey go di well for di chamber, Oga Panetta, dey go dere, dey call di money well, well.

Di $2.85 billion plan include $500 million for low interest, $1 billion for highway construction fund, and $135 billion divided between general emergency assistance, and reserve to dey for President Bush to meet unanticipated costs from di two disaster.

Di funds dey addition to $1.1 billion hey o last month to assist on top di recovery from Hugo, e go bring di total for di two disaster to almost $4 billion for inside unanticipated spending.

Wit di vaga wey Gramm-Rudman dey kause, na small wahala e dey kause.

Within di appropriation process, di situation even worse o, di amount wey dey go on top di subsidy, na im dey carry am pass sey de go carry am go give di subsidy wey e never see before sey e go hard am to keep inside di budget.

Di underlying bill wey dey approved yesterday go continue government wey dey operate till midnight, and dis urgency na im don contribute to di speed, and, critics say, mistake na im don accompany di package of disaster assistance.

Di goment don dey plan to increase money wey be sey de wan put more money wey be sey de wan increase money wey be sey de wan increase for emergency highway assistance, dan to increase am.

And di state delegation dey fear sey di new funding go count against separate $185 million for federal highway fund wey go dey expected to receive under di normal allocation dis year.

Also, di high price of San Francisco real estate, na im dey affect di state wit different federal law wey dey different from national average.

But San Francisco delegation dey find out on top sey de dey carry di cap per household to $500,000 from $100,000 to assist di hard hit wey dey come, but most of di money na Marina district.
