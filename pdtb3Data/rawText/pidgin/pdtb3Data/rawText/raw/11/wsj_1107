Dis one na for response to George Mellon's business world column, The Housing Market Is a Big Mess Than You Think (Op-Ed page 26).

For Houston now, we don see how bad di housing problem go be.

House wey no good for house dey spoil anyhow, e dey spoil anyhow near house, sotay all di whole area fit fall victim.

Sey dis stage, some people just dey waka comot from house wey di mortgage don expire.

But most of dem go fit continue deir money, but dem no gree.

Di problem big sotay we need to try innovative solution for small, small experiment.

Dis na some of di tins wey e fit do:

FHA fit sell some house for low price (di biggest problem for young people), but with personal liability for di mortgage (no waka by choice).

To encourage long stay occupied by togiving one month for every six months, or may be di down payment come to di end of di mortgage, but (for ) on a monthly pro-payment basis, as long as di owner remain di occupant.

Dey develop rent, and exclusive buy option for di renter.

People wey dey stay for una house, una go betta pass house wey empty.

Like dis, dem no dey trowey house put for where dem dey sell tins put.

Federal Housing Administration, Veterans Administration, and Department of Housing, and Urban Development, come add join di palava of housing stock wey dey, alas, many o, on top of deir closed property (of which one dey, alas, many), on top of deir mortgage due, say $80,000 on top one house worth five thousand, instead of free market to price di house for wetin e really cost.

E go worse, di property den, e go dey deteriorate for maybe a year, or so, but dem go sell am later (because of di attractiveness of di low down price, ehn) to poor buyer wey no fit buy di mortgage, and na small money wey dey buy am go take buy am again, and di bad-bad ting wey e go carry go, na im go carry am go.
