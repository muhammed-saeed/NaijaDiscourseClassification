When Trinity Repertory Theater, Anne Bogart artistic director last spring, di nation theatre cognoscenti come do tear rubber.

Ms. Bogart, one person wey dem dey call drama, dey do dramatic collage wey tear into sacred texts like Rodgers and Hammerstein'S South Pacific, de don decide to do downtown.

Trinity Rep, meanwhile one of di nation oldest, and most respected regional theatre, na im dey still hold one annual Christmas Carol.

How dis tins go take happen for Ms. Bogart hand?

She hold her first fire with her first release for Trinity earlier dis season.

It was a predictable revival of her prizewinning offroadway anthology of Bertolt Brecht theoretical writings wey dem dey call No Play, No Poetry.

Now with di opening of Maxim Gorky bourgeois-bashing SUMMERFolk, mtschew e don carry her card put for table.

Shey na hand na im go test her audience.

For mtschew dis one wey be Ms. Bogart, wey first study and direct for Germany, na some kind European directors like Peter Stein, Giorgio Strehler, and Ariane Mnoukkuk, dey stage her production wit Brecharia rigor weda di text want make e do or not.

And Gorky wey be Soviet socialist realism, no write play wey dey easily lend demsef to anti-realistic distaining tactics.

Gogorky dey loyal if sometimes e get one kind proletarian paper wey dem dey call Chekhovian Humanism.

And September fool penned in 1904 as one kind of sequel to Chechariah's (Cherry Orchard) is a lawn party of Russian yuppies to an exhausting political fight to di end of allrightnik and di reformers.

By di way, a lot of romantic dalliences dey.

Wise Ms. Bogart don keep Gorky time well, well.

No be small wahala, no be small wahala, no be small wahala, but na plenti- plenti pipol wey dey sell and sell tins give oda pipol. Dem dey do evritin wey dem fit do with evritin wey dem fit do with evritin wey dem fit do.

But apart from dis one wey be sey de dey do, Ms. Bogart, and company head dey do one kind stylist wey all of dem dey do, but dis one wey be sey Gorky drama, na im dey turn into someting wey be sey na small, small tin.

Di director try to force Brektian make e dey between im actors and im character many times backfire with di yama, yama wey dem dey do.

No be only sey deir actors dey stand for outside deir character and de dey at odds wit dem, but most of dem, de dey stand on top each oda.

Like Peter Sellars, Ms. Bogart dey manipulate her actors like sey dem be rago, wrapa dey hang dem for upstairs, dey hang dem for table, dey hang dem from precipciple, dey do some kind exercise wey dem dey do.

E get moments for dis "Summerfolk" wey di characters dey populate di big, big country house (wey be like parody of Frank Lloyd Wright and Victoria Petrovich) supplication of philosophies with di rat-... tat-... tat-... laugh in, one of dem say.

Di clash of ideologies survive dis treatment, but di nuance and richness of di Gorky character don vanish for di scuffle.

Gorky text dey make us laugh sotey we paint am for big big stroke (especially for small group). E dey show and e dey make nois.

Mtschew na music e prefer pass, when e want, as e dey like so e dey like make e use Gorky voice talk am.

E get help from her longtime associate wey im name na Jeff Helpern, wey she appoint Trinity Music Director and e come equipped with one Spanish king wey get one record of new music, and record studio.

For Gorky, Oga Helpern, dem do one kind debussy, and Rukmaninoff wey no be like dis on top one level of view.

Wit Brecht, and indeed Ezra Pound, Ms. Bogart don yarn sey di way wey she take dey do di original recording of di album, na just one attempt to make am new, whereas for one new post release talk, di director come explain sey her best artistic wish be sey na to play on top of di Rainbow, so dat di original beauty go come through, climb di cliche.

Di danger wey Ms. Bogart appear to dey court here na one of obfuscation, no be rejuvenation, one vision wey be sey, di two point wey dey view, no be light, instead of light.

Ms. Bogart cast na part of di problem.

Ed Shea, and Barbara Orson no get any real reason for di kind love wey dem get for each oda as di foolish, ogbonge young Vass, and di tireless humanitarian doctor, Maria Lvovna.

Cynthia Strickland as long as Varvara na tayo o, no be di support of Boldo revolutionary Gorky wan do.

Better reason to look for corner of the page for performance wey dey inspire, or amuse.

Jane Duclos na also person wey get one of the better song wey people dey sing for evening and e get one of the thing wey no suppose touch person like Olga o, mama of everybody.

Marni Rice dey play di maid well, well sotay e wan thief two times.

But na di Trinity Renewcomer, Jonathan Fried (Zamislov), wey be di actor dey watch, wheder e dey do di chamber music, or dey dey deceive im neighbour wife (Becca Lish) by licking her bosom.

Ms. dey always write about theatre.
