But traveler mahnsef, na im don affect am before.

For recent weeks now, airlines don cut many fares for inside the leisure market to try to catch customers.

Before now, airlines dey limit programme because de dey too expensive.

For example, last week now wey be Trans World Airlines and Pan Am Corp, Pan American World Airways go far, go offer cash, or money tax wey be sey de dey sell subsidy, and money wey be sey de dey sell business class, or first class.

Di industry slow down wen aMR Corp., wey be American Airlines parent talk sey eight eight8% fall for di third quarter net income, e say di fourth quarter go dey point gbi-... gbi-... gbi-... gbi-... gbi-... gbi-... gbi-... gbi-... gbi-... gbi-... gbi-... gbi-... gbi.
