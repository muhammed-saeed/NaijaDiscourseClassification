After many years wey China dey do business, foreign traders dey make am difficult for di biggest slump in a decade.

Di imposition of austerity measure, starting last October, e don already begin to pinch when massacre for Tiananmen Square on June 4 and after, dem come drag di belt go far.

Most government don dey suspended since den, dem dey choking liquidity, dey honbol many projects.

And Beijing don come back ontop domestic loan, and subsidy, e don leave many domestic buyers, and export company company wey be sey deir pocket dey buy.

Givaudan Far East Ltd, one Swiss concern wey dey sell chemicals to shampoo, and soap factories for China, dey typify di problem.

Last year own retrenchment dry up di working capital of Chinese factories.

Almost every second for 1989 na im di company dey sell market.

Di June killing don magnify di wahala.

For Kanton, Givaudan's representative office, dem no give orda for June.

Di first one wey dey relate na di slump to temporary business disruption, but wen no order come out for August, and September, manager Donald Lai con dey sure sey di business go bad for many months.

Tings don dey worse since June 4 wey Oga Lai talk.

E dey predict sey sales go drop between 30%, 40% from last year three million.

Consumers, and electricity market dey under di brunt of China austerity measure, and foreign companies like Givadan wey dey deal with dem, na dem dey suffer am pass.

But in general, all di foreign company dem dey feel am.

Di import pie go reduce, John Kamm, first vice president for American Chamber of Commerce for Hong Kong, and China trade specialist, na im talk sey on top down side, de go fall as 90% for some company, upper side, de go dey sell o. China go continue to dey do foreign trade since ten years.

Di last time wey be sey na when Beijing begin dey ban import, and save foreign exchange, na for di end of 1985 86.

Di current trough suppose deep well, well because Beijing don cut domestic money from factories di first time to reduce inflation.

Also, di suspension of loan, and export credit from foreign government, and institutions following di June killing, na big setback.

Di freeze on new lending na on top di biggest biggest tin wey dey happen for business, according to Raymond Wong, wey be China manager for Mannesmann AG, one West German machinery trading company.

For August and July, dem reduce di number of pipol wey dey grow from one year go reach 16% for Judicia and 71% for August.

For di first eight month of 1989, import come grow 21% to 38.32 billion ah from di growth of 23% during last year.

Di picture for China go just dey bleak, mainly because of di domestic credit wey dey squeeze dem.

For di first eight months, dem increase only 9% to $31.48 billion compared to di growth of 25% during di year before according to Chinese customs figures.

Di threat to China dey worse na di one wey dey sink for di foreign exchange reserve, plus di one wey dey hold gold.

Di reserves dropped for di first time in recent years to $14 billion in June from $19 billion in April.

Di trend don make Beijing begin dey increase importation.

For recent weeks now, China leader don start to dey do business of wool, and many chemical, and commodity.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade bin set up one special bureau last month to monitor di import, and export licence.

Di Brexit matter wey dey happen for China now, don teach plenty business people sey di best way to take enter di drought na to help China export.

For example, Nissho Iwai Corp, one of di biggest japan trading house now, na almost double as e take dey sell for China as e dey sell give dat country.

Three years ago, di ratio don reduce.

But di strategy no help much dis time, di two sectors of import, and export look just as bad tin dey, na Masahiko Kitamura wey be di general manager for Nissho Iwai office o.

E expect make di company trading go drop like 40% for dis year.

Small time after June 4, e be like sey di trade picture go dey shine well, well.

Many foreign business bureau for Hong Kong get telexe and telephone call from Chinese business people wey dey tell dem sey make dem no sell at all.

Even di Bank of China, wey normally dey take weeks to process credit, e dey settle di letters fast, fast to troway rumour sey bank dey too weak.

But when foreign traders try dey do business, de go see sey di way Chinese people dey do business, na smokescreen.

Di suspension of foreign loan don weak di power wey China national trading company get, wey be one of di biggest importers for di country.

Sey business no go better for provincial, and municipal level, foreign traders talk.

: Shanghaihai Investment & Trust Co. (wey be Sitco) na di main financier for di city.

Sico don customarily tap into Japanese bond market to get money, but e no fit do dat one again.

Di oga patapata say di company dey strap for cash.

Hong Kong executive wey know Sitco business, how e go take get money wey e go carry buy?

Di foreign traders too dey yarn sey many of China big infrastructural project don cancel, dem don postpone am because of di squeeze on top domestic, and foreign credit.

Albert Lee, one veteran trader wey sabi do machinery, dem say as many as 70% of di project wey dem don approve to proceed, na almost no new project and na im be sey no new business we dey do.

Even when new lending resume, foreign exchange go still dey tight because Beijing go try to increase foreign borrowing wey don climb between 30% to 40% since last few years.

And foreign lender, e fit be sey e go make sense to extend new loan, because China don dey near di peak of payment rate as e dey take am from di next two to five years.

Anoder ting wey cause di trade wahala be sey, Beijing don extend di current clamping on top import wey be sey e go include steel, chemical fertilizer, and plastic.

Dis na some of di country wey dey lead import, especially last year wey e get shortages wey make many traders dey buy plenty, plenty, plenty money.

But di shortages also cause rampant speculation, and spiral price.

To stem speculation, Beijing don put ceiling wey happen earlier dis year.

Na traders wey buy wetin dey above, dem no wan take reslave, dem dey carry am enter deir stock.

Di way dem take dey produce stock don dey crush market.

But Beijing no fit cut back on top such essential import as raw materials for too long without shaming di country export business.

Mr. Kamm wey be China trade, dem talk sey di way dem take dey do dis Guangdong export, na im dey do am with di processed imported raw materials.
