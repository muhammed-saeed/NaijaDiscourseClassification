Siad Barre regime for Somalia fit rank No. 1 for di world.

Di only reason why Somalia remain be sey na numbers o, one small group of oyibo people wey be sey de waka about, na 8.5 million people wey be sey dem don spread well, well for almost di size of Texas.

Di Barre dictatorship simply limited in di number of people wey e fit torture, and kill.

Ehn small children, stabbing old people death, rape, shooting women, and burying people alive, na just some of di yama, yama wey Somali army don dey do since two years.

Up to 500,000 sojas don escape to di relative safety of Marxist Ethiopia because of di way wey Presido Barre army dey do.

For May 1988, dem kon karry many men from one tribe wey dem dey koll Bera, go anoda town wey dem dey koll Issak. Dem arrest dem for kourt kon put dem for nite for five to 50 men wey dem sey make dem kill without kourt.

Dem nor use gun take kill Gun, each of dem use big knife take kut dem to pieces.

Di kain bad report wey dey happen now just dey come out from one kind ogbonge report wey get hundreds of interviews wit randomly selected refugees.

Di study na by Robert Gersony wey be consultant to U.S. State Department wey don dey investigate human right matter matter for both side of di political divide.

But wetin dey different from wetin dey happen now be sey na part of anoda drama wey dey affect di U.S. and Russia Union on top di horn of Africa.

No be sey de don dey drag horn since di 1970 Xeno wey be sey na only few weeks now we don dey drag horn.

Oga Barre rule don dey weak well, well.

Mutiny wrack im arm robbers (dem be sey na armed gang), wey control less than half of di country.

Lower level now don dey.

Desperate, e don call Libyans to help di rebels of di Somali National Movement for di north which only one group dey pick up for di regime for di capital of Mogadishu.

Seventy years old, and one self-declaring socialist, president barre don get power base, only im minority Mareham clan wey according to observers, na arrowing.

U.S. dey interest for Somalia one single runway for di port of Berbera wey U.S. military aircraft get right to use take dey monitor di Gulf of Aden, and di Indian Ocean.

Dat strip of concrete, na few building block wey dey for one side, air conditioning shack wey be sey na small number of American nationals dey dere, but na imported food, cold mineral, and back issues of sports Illustrate, dem dey do am to maintain radio talk outside di world.

For two years now, di desert wey dey behind dem don turn where dem dey kill pipol and na so-so fight dem dey fight demsef and na so-so fight dem dey fight demsef.

Dem still talk sey : â€œAs long as the group wey dey under Soviet government wey dey call Mengistu Haile Mariam dey fight war for Ethiopia, dem come force am make e enter one place wey dem dey call Ber Beraa (wey be Soviet Union) runway (wey be No. 2) go di next door for Soviet Union (wey be Soviet Union).

But because of wetin dey happen for di war wey don pass some days, and weeks now, e fit be sey na small, small wahala, as e dey lonely for America runway.

For Sept. 7, I write for dis page about di kill and capture of 10,000 Ethiopia soldier by Eritrean and Tigrean Gurillas.

E never too tey wey for Wollo province wey dey for Ethiopia side, Tigrean army don kill, wound, capture anoda 20,000 government people. (Selah.) Consider di headline wey dey fly for Lebanon, small country wey dey strategic.

Turkish army don dey reach 200 miles for north of Addis Ababa, e dey threaten di town of Dese, wey go comot Mr. Mengistu capital from Assab port, where all fuel, and oil dey reach Addis Ababa.

Na im make dem force Mr. Mengistu to carry thousands of soldier from Eritrea just to hold di town, so dat dem go fit even lose more territory for Eritrea only to protect di tins wey dey dere.

Dem dey opress Mr. Mengistu and half of en sojas dey kom from Eritrea go fight against Asmara wey dey nort.

If e dey weak, di more e dey weak for wahala, di more e go turn face U.S.

Di Tikigreans na group wey get pawa pass for di world and dem suffer well-well for World War I. E pass ten years wey di Soviet air force take dey bombard dem with bomb.

Wetin dis one mean be sey Soviet dominiation for Ethiopia dey collap as per President Barre regime for Somalia.

So U.S. get historic opportunity now to strike on human rights rights for Somalia, and to overtake superpower flip-flop for di Horn of Africa in di late 1970 era.

and from der go Somalia.

State Department on top of di matter don already begin dey fall on top demself from Oga, Barre comot wit di decision to publish di Gersony report (wey di press don ignore).

Di U.S. don suspend $2.5 million for military aid, and $1 million for economic aid.

But dis one no do o.

Because U.S. still dey tied to Mr. Barre, when e go di runway, e fit go too.

Considering how serious di security of dat runway be anyway, di better option na both moral, and strategic e go be for di Bush administration to throw di regime outside in terms of all powerful Somalis to understand.

I know sey Oga, Barre time na im dey count.

But make di U.S. govnor dey kareful sey en own position for di country, nor dey with am.

Nobody sure sey wetin go happen for Somalia now, or who go replace am?

But as one expert dey tell me sey person wey be sey e go work very, very hard to worse pass Barrre.

While di state department position dey for di post-barre period for Somalia, make e continue to dey in dia hand as mediator between Mr. Mengistu and Eritrean guerrilla for Ethiopia, and go continue to dey open channel of communication with di Tigrean rebels through neighbour Sudan.

Ethiopian politics na di most sophisticated, secretive, and byzantine for all black Africa.

Remember sey e take Mr. Mengistu many months for wetin dem dey call "Ccreep coup" to top Emperor Haile Selassie for 1974, and 1975.

There is simply no way to engineer a succession cover, as sometimes for di continent.

But U.S. dey get one big advantage na sey Russia dey kill all di pipol for di whole Ethiopia, bikos of wetin dem do to di country for ten years.

No be only for eastern Europe di waka wey dey happen now don dey reach U.S. side, but for African horn too.

Only U.S. liability for di region, na im remain di link to Oga Barre, and na dem go cut fast.

Mr. Kaplan, di author of Sirender or Starve, di Wars Behind di Famine, 1988, na im dey live for Lisbon.
