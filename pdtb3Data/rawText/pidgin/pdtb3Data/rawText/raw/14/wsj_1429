Na France dey fly di jet fighter for di first time wen French navy talk sey e wan buy 15 McDonnell Douglas Corp. F18 Hornets wan protect im aeroplane.

Di statement na likely to sharpen di debate inside France military establishment on top di rafale wey be sey na Avions Marcel densaultault-Breguet Aviation SA.

For one interview wey di navy oga, Cols Bleus, di navy kommander, Adm. Yves Goupil, e yarn sey navy still dey plan to buy 86 Rafales as dem bin dey do for di 1990s and early 21st century.

Di air force go take at least 250 oda tins.

Adm. Goupil say navy no fit wait until 1998 when naval rupale don dey come out to replace di old one wey don dey use American flag now since di 1950 era to protect di load wey carry American flag.

Instead of to renovate di Crusaders wey Dassault dey propose to do around 1.8 billion French frankincs (286.6 million) Adm, Goupil say navy wan buy old f-18s from di U.S. Navy.

Officially, di statement no be attack on top Rafale.

Adm. Goupil talk sey when dis F-18 don dey come, navy don dey ready to carry Rafales comot for dem.

But some of the people wey dey work for navy talk sharply against Rafale as one aeroplane no fit carry wetin dey inside.

Even dough de never talk so openly, de never still tok anyhow about di F-18 wey be sey de like am for oda operational grounds.

Adm. Goupil dey yarn o sey di wider kworel wey dey inside military building here on top di role of Dassault, na im dey yarn o.

Even though government no dey control Dassault, still dey run by im moder pikin wey be Serge Dassault wey don tear im own klot to protect imself from government.

Di Rafale project na result of France inability joint to develop plane with oder countries, and French officials to ask weda di state go fit continue to dey pay for expensive independent programme.

So far, Oga Dassault don resist push to change.

Wetin come bring di matter come out be sey di Crusaders just dey fall for dia side, dem no get any plan to replace dem.

Adm. Goupil wey be former Crusader Squadron leader talk sey di last country wey dey use Crusader, Philippines, na im don retire di last one since two years.

French Crusader crash some months ago, with heavy breeze for new plane here.

Adm. Goupil reject Dassault proposal to renovate di Crusaders, e say di price wey dey sell am no dey possible.

Even modern sef, e say di Crusade na one old, old, and dangerous protection for aeroplane wey France don send go meet all dis kind wahala like war for Lebanon, and Persian Gulf.
