Ducks.

If di Oyinbo house get spot one, e wan setol am.

Duck na di new tax wey dey under OMB director, Richard Darman formulation sey if e be like duck, waka like duck, waka like duck, na duck, na duck. George Bush is very clear, no new duck.

But what of all dis empty duck wey dey fly for Washington?

We see whole flock of programme wey go put big money on top American economy in di form of burden, and higher liabilities.

Federal Child Care (quarriage).

Clear Air bill (quirk).

Disability workers bill, kuku, kuku!

Di Bush White House dey produce nondo-do duck di way di Nixon White House do, na on top one matter wey no dey opposable. Clean air, better treatment of pikin wey no well, na im dey follow am.

E dey come out wit one toned version of a political proposal.

Di bill dey sign into law, and administration just dey watch o, dey wonder where di money wey de dey go come from.

For example, dem dey call the bird wey fat pass for bird wey dem dey call Federal Child Care.

Di Presido carry correct bill come, but may be eazy to sign di awful bureaucratic creature hatched on Capitol Hill.

Di one go create 38,000 local creche commission, answerable for Department of Health and Human Services.

Dem go determine where parents fit keep deir pikin for day time, and de go regulate storage facility.

Di initial price wey de say na $2 billion a year, but na only di beginning.

New entitlement don dey grow, so make person get reason for new tax.

Ka.

Di administration dey claim sey di clean air bill go cost between $14 billion and $19 billion yearly, but economist Michael Evans talk sey di money wey dem dey pay for firms go actually dey di $60 billion a year range.

Di House bill too also affect economic efficiency in different ways.

For example, administration proposal dey bring strong, strong emission on top new power plant.

So, instead of building new one for modern, use stick take dey scrub di old plant.

Di money wey we dey spend on scrubbers, dey divert from planned research on new, cleaner technology.

Di bill also impose California auto emissions standard on all cars nationwide as per a car wey dey registered for Big Sky, Montana, dem need to dey clean as per person wey dey drive for Los Angeles.

Opposition from nationwide standard say di money wey car owners go pay na about $500 per car.

Oda analysts talk sey dat one dey low.

Ka.

Nobody know how many dollars American With Disabilities Act go cost because nobody know wetin dey inside di bill.

Na one kind vague document wey go cause wave of litigation.

Judge go write di real bill just as dey roll for court.

Ladies go gain.

Private company, and ultimately deir customers, de go foot di big bill.

Nixon time na law and distortion dey control how people dey behave.

All dis one, de don recognize am, de don record am for di succeeding years wey di economists, some of dem wey go do di Reagan administration take remove dis load from American people, state, and local government.

For 1980, and 1988, George Bush also take eye see di economic stagnashon wey dey inside 1970s.

In fact, during last year campaign, di whole nation con dey hear Oga, Bush wey be di head of di Task Force on Regulatory Relief.

Government continue to dey reduce productivity of our citizens, and international competition of American business na im di Vice Presido talk when e be head of di task force.

But di shuku-shuku wey dey inside dis new programme, Oga, bush go dey send plenty, plenty people go back to di regulatory tin wey e don cut back.

By 1986, Federal Regret do down to about 103,000.

Den e con turn up, and one estimate say di number go reach about 109,000 regulator by next year.

Holding di dam on top tax na di most important task for Bush presidency.

We for don reason now sey a lot of people wey dey do government life, wey dey see sey direct tax, no be di only way to slow down economy be dat.

E just dey obvious.

Wetin even worse pass bi sey, for di whole world, pipol dey learn how to setol wahala and block government law.

But as e dey take load, United States don dey close to give three more kings.

Bush administration suppose dey keep some of di buckshot for di non-duck duck.
