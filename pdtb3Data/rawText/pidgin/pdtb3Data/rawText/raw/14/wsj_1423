When Supreme Court finally allow Missouri to do abortion last July, Justice almost no dey drive, dey do trespass, dey lie for dia head.

But di 5-4 wey dey go on top di matter, especially di one wey concern abortion right.

Di decision, Webster vs.

Product of Health Services, for example, how Supreme Court ruling don dey affect many, many times, e don dey spread to different parts of law, and policy wey no dey inside di law, and wey di law never dey considered before.

In Missouri case, unexpected consequence may have arise because di Supreme Court reinstate di state s 1986 abortion law.

Preamble talk sey human being life start at conception, and unborn children get right for constitution.

Last year, one federal court for St. Louis say di preamble dey unconstitutional citing one earlier Supreme Court wey rule say states no fit justify strict abortion by changing di definition of when life start.

But Supreme Court con conclude sey na premature judgement on top di constitutionality of di preamble because sey de never use human being to circumcise abortion.

Di high court most of dem say na state court now to judge wheder di definition get any bearing on oder state law.

Local Missouri judge don already put on top di restored case for two separate case wey e go carry out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion protesters wey block access to Reproductive Health Services, abortion clinic for St. Louis.

Di pipol wey dey disturb di king kon sey, “Wetin dem do dey rite, bikos dem won save shidren wey nor fit born.”

Under one 1981 Missouri law, people wey dem accuse of some kind offence including sey dem trespass, fit come out den talk sey deir action dey justified (as an emergency measure to avoid imminent public injury), na preamble statement on top sey afetus na unborn pikin, two St. Louis County Circuit Court for August afta abortion clinic na im dey free to save life.

Anoder one wey cause wahala, Ann O'Brien, dem katch am say e do trespass before Supreme Court for Webster wey dey rule.

Last week, wen de bin drag for Missouri Court of Appeals, im lawyer too come dey rely on di preamble.

Di effect wey di Supreme Court, Webster opinion, na sey grass go dey grow for inside Roe vs crack.

Wike, and I tink sey dis one na one of di cracks", Mark Belz wey be St. Louis lawyer wey be Ms. O'Brien, and di oder St. Louis dey protest.

Road vs.

Wicked was the Supreme Court decision for 1973 wey allow woman to gree abortion.

Mario Mandina, wey be Kansas City lawyer for life, na im talk sey if abortion foes succeed to use preamble to escape prosecution for trespass, dis go block abortion for Missouri.

De no get risk for di protesters, and you no fit open abortion clinic open if na 3,000 people dey outside every day.

Dat one na ironic case wey be sey Supreme Court come stop to dey rule Roe vs.

Wendy.

Inside two oder cases, den possible consequences of di Supreme Court ruling, even more wey dey ground.

For one lawyer wey dey 20 years for Columbia, Mo wey dem slap for drunk driving, e argue sey make dem dey treat im client as 21 years because e suppose get from when dem born am, make e no get from when dem born am.

For Missouri, those wey dey between 16 to 21 fit get court permit for one year, while those wey be junior and senior dey go on top 30 days suspension.

One Boone County judge, reject di motion, but Daniel Dodson wey be Jefferson City lawyer, e yarn sey e don appeal.

And one case wey dey federal court for August, one lawyer dey argue sey Missouri authorities dey wrongly put etus of one pregnant woman wey dey for prison for stealing and forgery.
