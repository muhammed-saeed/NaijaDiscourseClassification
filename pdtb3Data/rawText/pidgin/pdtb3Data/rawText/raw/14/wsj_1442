When First Interstate bill just comot say di figure too dey high, regulators come raise deir recommendation to $350 million.

Dat point, na first Interstate, dem say na di best part of valor no be to dey negotiate further, na one industry oga wey dey close to di talk.

Other lenders don dey recover only 50 cents to 60 cents on di dollar ontop Eclosed Arizona property if dem fit sell am at all.

All dis wahala na di worst bus journey wey don happen for Arizona afta di boom and boom boom wey happen for 1980. Some of di usual suspect wey dey for 1980, na greed, bribe and bad banking.

For di late 1970, and early 1980, pipol wey dey borrow, and people wey dey build big house, house, big house, big tract for inside desert, dem dey sure sey Arizona people go dey increase every year from 4% to 6% for years.

And di general frailing condition of Arizona lender mean sey di state no get capital wey go fit shore up di economy, and e go slow down di slide.

E make sense to say no liquid liquid wey dem dey sell for state and viable bank capital, na very low price na im we dey go see for now and year end, di only tin wey dey dis people mouth na say make dem pay me in 60 days.

First Interstate get $214.4 million loss for 1988 third quarter mainly from write down, and reserve wit Texas operation.
