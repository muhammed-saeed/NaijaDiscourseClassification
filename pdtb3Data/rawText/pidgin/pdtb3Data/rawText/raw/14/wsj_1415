One bill wey go allow di Securities and Exchange Commission to monitor how much be securities firm holding company dey face strong wahala from some Wall Street firm wey dey argue sey di law dey unnecessary.

Di legislation, and oder issues wey concern stock market, na di focus of hears wey dey for di House Telegram, and Finance Submittee, and Senate Securities Submittee.

Richard Breeden wey be di new chairman for di Senate, e never do any formal position ontop di bill wey go also involve investors to talk big-big business, and give di SEC additional authority during market emergency.

But e recently talk to Senate Banking Committee sey e believe sey di agency go give dem extra authority to dey monitor how dem dey take dey hold company, and affiliate of broker wey dey always use to dey issue bridge loan.

Di bridge loan na to provide temporary financing for acquisition.

Since na high risk, high risk, junk bond, di new water wey dey market don bring out new wahala on top wall street wey be sey de dey construct bridge loan.

But some of di people wey dey inside di wall of di town, dey talk sey all dose kind fear no be war.

For July 6 letter to Senate Securities Submittee, First Boston Corp, dem argue sey di fact sey no retail broker fail for di 1987 market crash na im show sey di law wey dey inside now don get effect.

First Boston wey deir holding company, CS First Boston Group, na one of di big issue of bridge loan wey dey Wall Street, e con talk sey e too dey worry sey once SEC don get di power to dey monitor hold company, e go try to regulate wetin dey happen.

Di proposal, while e dey for proper purpose, I think fit deceive me because di likely consequence go be weaker, instead of stronger authority for SEC don exercise for 50 years on top financial adequacy, and viability of broker-dealer, Michael Raoul-Duval wey be Managing Director for First Boston talk for interview.

Di bill go "di scarce resources of di commission from broker to broker to places where e no dey easy to deal with traders", Oga Raoul-Duval talk.

Sources for di industry, and Capitol Hill say one compromise wey go placate di industry, and address di SEC concern, fit be sey e go possible.

An aide wey dey Senate Securities Submittee dey yarn sey some lawmakers dey support di idea of risk disclosure, but add sey nobodi dey supported di language for di bill.

Adward O'Brien, wey be president of Securities Industry, talk sey di securities industry, dem write di bill, but sey na "hopeful compromise go fit reach dem to achieve di SEC goal."

Oga O'Brien go elaborate on top di SIA stand before di House Telegram and Finance Subcommitee dis week o.
