David Baltimore wey just dey call am president of Rockefeller University, e don already know wetin e be like to waka through life wit Nobel laureate applaud one name.

E don dey experience wetin e be like to get di phrase “under investigation for scientific fraud” also attached to im name.

Nobel committee na im produce di first addition, and John Dernier's congressional committee na im produce di second one.

Two of Dr. Baltimore public face don dey judge am since weeks wen e dey consider to succeed Joshua leatherberg wey be di head of Rockefeller research institution.

It was to light that many Rockefeller faculty were upset, or even opposed to Dr. Baltimore's impending appointment.

Dem disturb dem for wetin dem dey call Dr. Baltimore talk about di matter wey concern one lab paper wey one person wey don do scientific paper with Dr. Baltimore write.

People wey dey read dis one wey be Science Article May 15 go recall sey Dr. Baltimore na just di most popula part of di fragment committee wey touch MIT, Tufts, Duke, National Institute of Health, and oder.

Rep. Dennerford sef even try enta di services of di Secret Service inside im investigation wey e do inside di Baltimore paper.

Insofar as Mr. lingurill get one special interest for NIH, and university wey dey receive funding, doz rockefeller scientists, do not doubt sey dis one wey be Baltimore's unflating public opinion of dis congress patron, wey im behaviour dey remind Dr. Baltimore of di McCarthy era.

Dis one fit be di first time wey di venerable Rockefeller university don come outside from di intimidation wey dey ehn US science people.

John Diedell demagogue adversity adversity adversity adversity adversity adversity do $3.5 million for lab wey dey U.Cal-Davis, Meryl Streep dey yarn for inside federal court on top twart biotech, and Dutch-elm-disease researcher, Gary Strobel wey dey Montana State, dey yarn sey e go fight against EPA law.

Scientists mistakenly think sey di anti-science movement wey dey dis country no concern dem, or sey David Bla gree placard John Derrick.

Dingell, by di way, e don koll anoda NIH investigation on top di Baltimore paper plus many oda investigations.

E get one oder ting wey most scientists go con recognize sey de dey find for here.

Happily, e get signs wey be sey as many people wey be scientist, de dey see wetin dem need to talk.

David Hubel wey be Nobel laureate for Harvard don take di lead for inside research wit animals as Dr. Michael Debakay.

APOSTLE PAUL talk sey : “As e dey defend imselfself well well against one suit wey e wear for Galilee, na so e do.

Science people need to understand sey di main thing wey deir work be sey deir work na to just get new knowledge, or to do better, today na to give power.

For one kind media linked world, scientists dey collect big praise, and even Nobel for dia work, but dem dey attract people wey wan gain gain for di content, funding, and goals of dat work.

When one David Baltimore, or di next target decide say e better make e stand up for dis people, e go good make e know wetin dey important for di matter, and give dem support.
