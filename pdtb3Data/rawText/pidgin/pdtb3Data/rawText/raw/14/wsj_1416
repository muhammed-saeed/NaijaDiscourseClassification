Dis one na from David Asman Sept. 25 editorial page about Fidel Castro wey dey di Middle of Drug Trafficking.

I don organize exchange, exhibition, and oder ongoing projects between Cuban, American Artists.

Any matter wey concern Cuban, e no get as e be na im make me know Cuban art, and artist, and also Cuban bureaucrat, and deir counterpart for our own government.

Despite di level wey e dey do, di level wey e dey do, di level wey e dey do, di level wey e dey do, di level wey e dey do, di level wey e dey do, all dis project still dey my mind, no be small, no be small.

Dis one na kukuruku for dis one.

Make I no waste time to do anytin wey fit dey person mind.

Dose people wey I dey talk about so, no be only artist, critic, taxi drivers, grand-grand papa dem, even some people wey be sey dem be di Ministry of Culture, dem dey talk sey as per di original rules of di Cuban Revolution, all of dem dey feel am, dey feel am, dey feel am, dey feel am, dey feel am, dey feel am, dey feel am, dey feel am, dey feel am, dey feel am, dey feel am, dey feel am, dey feel am, dey feel am, dey feel am.

In fact, di generation wey dey paint now, e dey do with di kind seriousness wey human being dey feel sey, dey serious for moral, and ethical matter wey dey make Che Che Che, wey dey famous for art, idealism, and revolution e dey do.

Na for dis people, and for my own good head, I dey answer Oga God, asman talk for dia country.

Di Ochoa trial for July wit e revelations of deeply rooted, widespread corruption, and di summary trial and execution, e dey very painful for anybody wey don ever consider imsef to be Cuba friend.

But even if na so e be, dem no still get any excuse to take waka anyhow from di truth.

Mr. Assman suppose dey different from Fidel, army and Cuban people.

Dem no interchange fit do wetin dey dia own way.

E no dey make sense to equate government policy with wetin di people want (we know), and even worse pass dis one wey Fidel, military, state bureau dey do.

Oga Asan also vex sey Oga, Castro don resign sey e no gree join U.S. government o, even though sey na im own account wey be sey de don devise am, sey na as e take dey do act, na im be sey na as e take dey do act, na im be sey na as e take dey do act, na im be sey as e take dey do act, na im be sey na as e take dey do act, na im dey do am to stop all di things wey dey happen to di Cuban regime.

I tink sey na small tin wey dey surprise me be sey, Fidel no dey invite U.S. State Department to do wetin dey against di Cuban government on top im own territory.

Wi go must do wetin dey rite, nor bi wetin pipol dey tok.

Without this basic attention to reality, our policy on top Cuba go continue to dey slow down as dem don dey do am for 30 years.

From my own point of view, di tings wey human being get, di creativity, and warm spirit wey Cuban people dey excel, we deny oursef with tings wey we dey hold dear, and e be like sey dey run short for dis days.

De no get justification for dat kind behaviour.
