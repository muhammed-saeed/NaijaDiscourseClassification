Wit di san wey dey come out from di failed coup attempt for Panama, one of di many lingering questions wey di Bush administration go ponder, na im be sey dis one wey be sey National Security Council staff big o, and e get enough staff wey go do im work on top foreign policy?

President Bush's National Security Advisory Council, Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, enter office for January on top di NSC staff leaner and more correction wey dey inside di Reagan administration.

Gen. Scowcroft na member of di Tower Commission wey chook eye for di matter wey concern di Iranian Contra affair.

Sey oya o, sey oya o, sey ah o, sey ah o, sey ah o, sey na oyibo o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o

So following di style wey e pursue as President Ford's national security adviser, and recommendation of di Tower Commission, Gen. Scowcroft, e don prune di NSC staff to di level wey e suppose do, namely to gather di views of State Department, Pentagon, and intelligence group, to serve as honest broker wey be sey de dey process information for di president, and den to make sure sey presidential decision dey take place.

Di Tower Commission specifically talk sey make di NSC staff dem nko, and warn dem sey make dem no allow energetic self starters like Lt. Col. Oliver North come outside on top demself say make dem no dey comot for day to day execution of policy to State Department, Pentagon or Central Intelence Agency.

But, di Panama episode don bring out question weda di NSC staff too big, different, and powerful to coordinate U.S. policy on top strong wahala.

During di coup attempt, and aftermath, NSC staffers stretched very thin, na one senior administration oga, na very small shop.

Gen. Scowcroft no plan to add staff now, but dey weigh dat possibility, di govnor add.

NSC staff, doesn't have di horsepower wey I believe to have effective interage process, na im Frank Gaffney, wey be former Pentagon aide, wey dey now for Centre for Security Policy, one conservative Washington think tanker, di wahala wey dey dis administration, I tink sey, by design, e don dey reduced well, well in physical sense, and in procedural sense, di role of di NSC.

Di National Security Council sef, dem establish am for 1947 because policy makers dey reason sey dem need more, more complex world, for one formal system within di White House to make sure sey communication dey go smoothly between di Presido, State Department, Pentagon and intelligence agencies.

By law, di council include presido, vice president, secretaries of state, defense.

In practice, di director of central intelligence, and chairman of di Joint Chiefs of Staff, na im dey also do dis one wey be unofficial.

But di size, shape, and role of di NSC staff don dey for each president, and im national security adviser to decide.

Dat task na one of Washington perennial problem.

For inside Bush White House, di size of di NSC staff of professional officers is down to about 50 from about 70 in 1987, administration officials dey yarn.

Administration people dey insist sey di number of staff no be problem during di Panama crisis.

But one clear wahala during di coup attempt be sey di NSC staffer most, most experienced for Latin America, Everett Briggs don go.

E just resign at least for some part because of one feud with Assistant Secretary for State Bernard Aronson on top administration policy on top Panama and support for Nicaragua Contra rebels.

Di absence of Mr. Briggs underscore di possible inadequacy of di current NSC staff.

Both Gen. Scowcroft and im deputy Robert Gates sabi for U.S.viet matter.

Gen. Scowcroft too dey very, very strong for hand, and Mr Gates don dey read di law for Soviet politics, and society.

Both of dem don become confidants of President Bush.

But no be many pipol dey Latin America, Middle East, Asia.

For dat area, di role of NSC staff wey dey dere, na im don dey important pass.

GEN. SCOWcroft know and anybody wey be sey one of di biggest wahala wey e dey face, na sey NSC staffers wey be sey dey work for relative sey na only dem dey do policy, and operational work wey be sey na from big, big state department, and Pentagon bureau na dem dey do am pass.

But as every oda NSC adviser don, na so Gen. Scowcroft now go come tear di ting wey be sey di NSC staff come too dey lean, too dey rest.
