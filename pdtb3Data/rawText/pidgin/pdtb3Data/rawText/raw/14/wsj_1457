E no get anybody wey wan contest for dis mayor race?

As de stumble and bumble on top election day two weeks from tomorrow, na im both Democrat David Dinkins and Republican Rudolph Giuliani dey inside trouble.

Mr. Dinkins, wey be U.S. president for Manhattan borough, na im dey come outside dey vex and e dey hold one comfortable lead for most of di public opinion matter.

But e don tay wey e dey do yeye tins wey e dey do afta 10 days wey e take dey do sex wey no clean for God eye and wey fit affect how e take dey rule dis tumumum city, e don become di first black mayor for New York.

Ordinarily, clever opponent go find way to take capitalize on di oder side comfort.

But Oga Giuliani wey be one of di main prosecutor now, e don tay wey e dey switch from im crime gang to politician wey dey yarn sey e fit know sometin about to run dis big, strong city.

And now, di crucial moment now, im dey run out of money.

Dis na di nation biggest city and usually, di mayor na di best politician for di country.

Democrats hope sey Mr. Dinkins fit become very, very big national leader.

Public talk don dey rule say for Oga, Giuliani, di best prosecutor, dem get chance for plenty katakata for inside Democratic territory, and dem go carry new political star up.

But e never work like dat.

Di Cinkin na correct, sloppy guy, na im David Garth, wey be regular campaign consultant for here wey don work for Mayor Edward Koch win for Sept. 12 Democratic Primary, di alternative na Giuliani.

I guess we go reluctant to go ahead, and do am, vote for Dinkins", na so Richard Wade, wey be political professor wey support Richard Ravitch, one also-ran for Democratic primary wey be sey nothing dey di oder side.

We dey pick steam, Roger Ailes, Oga Giuliani media consultant wey deir last big campaign put George Bush inside White House.

E still talk sey e never reach engine room, but di steam never reach engine room.

For, just as Oga Giuliani take dey handle one issue wey get Mr. Dinkin reeling, im campaign so, well, well, na money na im dey keep Oga Ailes business for di air outside Wednesday, or Thursday.

To help out dis week, di White House dey dispatch di chief of staff John Sununu, and three cabinet member na HUD'S Jack Kemp, Transportation, Samuel Skinner, and Treasury na Nicholas Brady according to Peter Powers wey be Giuliani campaign manager.

For wey be Republican wey begin dis campaign wit such high hopes, all dis one dey too dey yab me.

New York don dey suffer well, well before.

But di trouble wey e dey face now for Democratic Republic of Congo, e be like sey e big pass anytin wey e don face before.

Dis year, di city dey face budget wey fit even big up next year.

And e no surprise us sey many people wey dey face di wahala for di city, dey always dey on top, one ethnic group dey scrape wit anoder one.

Thomas Lessner wey be one of di local professor, and documenter for di legendary Fiorello Laguardia, di city fusion mayor wey join coalition mtschew dis one, but at least, de no con dey vex for each oda.

Di 62 years old Mr. Dinkins wey be ex-Marine don serve as city clerk, and as Manhattan borough president, job with limited executive position position (I dey ask you to do one big tin wey David Dinkins do), na so Oga Giuliani talk.

E win di contentious Mr. Koch for di Democratic primary because e be like sey e go fit heal di city area wound, and ethnically wound.

Im general election campaign na almost gragra like all dis picture and comforting words.

Im theme na unity, decency, humanity, bringing New York togeder again.

Di two candidate dey drag togeder to hold di debate, but Mr. Dinkins dey widely seen as di main tin wey dey hinder dem to do am.

Di 45 years old Mr. Giuliani don do one negative campaign to carry out vote leaning to Mr. Dinkins say e get to collect Dinkins negative up, na so Lee Miringoff wey be di Marist College of Public Opinion, na im dey yarn o sey dis one wey be sey our poll dey show sey people no like di attack o.

Why, even 20% of di Republican vote dey go Dinkins?

Na assault weapon, na im John Siegal, Oga Dinkin director, na im dey yarn o sey na one kind racist undertone wey dey under Giuliani effort.

Di Giuliani force, na conundrum.

On one side, Oga Giuliani wan cut through Mr. Dinkin credibility.

On top di oda one, e dey find how e go take convince people sey na im be di new Fiorello Laguardia ajebo, ajebo, ajebo, ajebo, ajebo, ajebo, ajebo, ajebo, ajebo, ajebo, ajebo, ajebo, ajebo, ajebo.

E don cause katakata for abortion, and gay rights, e don seek di support of Liberal, and Conservative parties (e win di Liberal endorsement), and e con turn to comedian Jackie Mason to help Jew voters.

Mr. Mason comot for di campaign after e tell tori people sey Mr. Dinkins na big shvartzer wit mout. Shvartzer na derogatory yiddish word for black person.

Mr. Dinkins concede say noting dey im hand to stumble and bumble.

Im fit match Jackie Mason wit im own Robert "Sonny" Carson, one angry street organizer wey dem convict sey kidnap dem for 1974.

Di Dinkins campaign na to pay Mr. Carson close to $10,000 to collect di vote on primary election day.

Paper work on how de spend am, e complete.

Oga, Carson dey on top sey im na antisemitic o.

Asked about dat di oder day, e say anti-semitic?

I be anti-white.

Oga, Dinkins na im trouble pass for im personal account.

E start for 1973 wen de bin call am Deputy Mayor, and one kind routine check wey show sey im never pay tax for di last four years.

Sey I dey always go do am tomorrow o, e con explain.

And now e don dey busy to explain to one of di way wey e take sell stock for inside inside City Broadcasting Co, na im im old friend, Percy Sutton, to im son David Dinkins Jr.

E don value di share pass $1 million two years ago.

E talk sey e sell di stock make e no for get quarrel for di matter as e dey vote for di City Board of Estimate.

E say im pikin never pay for di share.

E be like sey na serious tax evasion, Oga Ailes, di Giuliani media consultant, na im dey follow di same pattern o as tax returns.

De go wait make e talk about am until after de catch am.

E simply never explain why something wey be sey a million dollars end o, after five thousand two years, sey na giuliani campaign manager, sey na deir hand na im e go just suggest sey na di difference between di share and deir market.

So far, no one (nor even before U.S. Attorney Giuliani) don fit sabi just wetin law be, wetin im don break, or wetin tax be sey im don dey dodge.

Di crime dey go on top character, na im Ron Maiorana, wey be consultant to Giuliani campaign, na im e dey do o.

Evades and ducks.

E get history of deception, and dis one na di latest chapter.

E dey make people think maybe dis guy no be soquequequequequequequency after all, na im Mr. Garth, wey be Mayor Koch media consultant, na im dey yarn sey result go come out well, well pass people wey dey think.
