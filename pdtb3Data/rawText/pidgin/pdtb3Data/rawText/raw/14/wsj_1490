Di one wey fall for one six,79 billion buy of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. Dem don sama West Street oga patapata for one single deal wey dem lose for one single matter.

Di total of wetin dey dere na di estimated $7 million plus di $400 million wey di takeover na di $400 million wey di takeover tradas (dem dey call am arbitraire) suffer for 1982 when Gulf oil comot one $4.8 billion bid for City Service Co.

For di six trading days since UALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUALUAL ABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABAB.

Di arbs fit recouple part of deir paper loss if di UAL deal get patch up again, as e do for 1982 when Occidental Petroleum Co, save dem with $4 billion takeover of City Service.

In di meantime, di question wey investors dey drag be sey wetin be UAL stock?

Di short answer on a fundamental basis, na sey di stock get somewhere between $135, and $150 a share.

Dat one dey base on multiple evriwhere between 8.5 to 10 times UAL earnings, wey be sey somewhere, around $16 per share dis year.

Airplane price na about one percent of wetin dey di stock market ear, wey be sey na about 13 times we dey sell am.

Dat one na because airline earnings like dat of car makers dey suffer for cyclical up, and down for economy.

Dat analysis match up with stock traders talk sey despite di huge drop wey dey inside di stock, UAL never still reach di level wey be sey e fit attract people wey be sey dey buy only di money.

So anybody wey dey buy di stock now, na con dey do some kind special transaction wey be sey na recapitalisation, or takeover, and you go carry like dat take dey guess weda na possible.

One analyst wey no yarn o, con talk sey e believe sey di UAL pilot, and management fit do bid for inside $225 area, but sey e fit take three to four months to close.

At dat level, and given di uncertainty, e believe sey UAL stock must move nearer.

Other observers talk sey UAL get AU, na three hundred naira e take buy am, e fit hold di new one wey dey near di original level even if na sey management go back to di company dey run di company small, small, if na normal ting.

Na im make dem talk sey if dem buy am, e go pass three to four months e go pass, even if na sey di money go pass three to four months.

Investment bankers wey dey follow UAL talk sey di strongest impetus for one eventual deal, na sey di pilot don dey pursue more than two years o, and e no fit stop, e don dey near to succeed.

Di pilots get strong finance tool wey be sey dem go cut deir annual compensation by $200 million, and commit $200 million from deir pension money.

On Friday, de con still persuade di UAL flight attendants to join dem.

But, investment bankers talk sey banks no go fit borrow di almost $5 billion wey be sey de dey buy takeover, even if na small money person take dey arrange big money, maybe e even pass 17% on top di bank account wey be sey go take over from Northwest Airlines, NWA Corp. July.

Banks want see person wey dey put real money, dat is, subsidise di bank account for any kind deal.

Like dat de go dey figure, anoder person get even stronger reason wey go make di deal go work because de go lose deir money before di bank go lose deir own.

Banks too, de wan too call person ontop di telephone to settle problem wit di deal wey go bad, preferably one person wey be union leader.

Dat one still dey leave pilots to dey collect money dey go about one billion naira, no be sey dem, or flight attendants fit carry only deir hand for di pension money.

One wahala wey be sey de dey find so much money, na deir insistence on most owner.

Some investors like Marvin Davis of Los Angeles wey don buy airline this year, dem don insist say no be pilot na im dey control dem.

One way wey dem take escape dat problem fit be partial recapitalisation wey di pilots go wind up and down wit public shareholders.

Di pilots fit borrow money against deir concession, dey use di money dey buy stock give public, and dey give dem big, big control wey dem dey find.

But e no clear sey bank go borrow big money to give shareholders big money.

No be sey any new money go still comot for di bank.

E advise di UAL board on top di different bid wey di airline carry from one to two billion naira from Mr. Davis wey be di Investment Bank of First Boston come out wit different potential value for di company based on di assessment method, and assumptions.

Wit di NWA takeover na benchmark, First Boston on Sept. 14 estimate sey UAL cost of $250 to three44 naira on top UAL result for di 12 months wey dey finish inside June 30, but na only $235 to $266 wey be sey na from inside management report for 1989.

The number wey we give for the first Boston projection na 1989 one.

Depending on how di company go take get dia future earnings under different circumstances, na $248 to $287 na im dem dey share weda na wall street projection, $237 to $275 if di company go strike wit pilot wey be like di one wey dey NWA, $98 to $121 under an adverse labor market, and $229 to $270 under di company wey dey nationwide strike.

And dis one wey be sey dey sell all UAL, first boaz wey be sey de dey sell di airline, na 253 to 303 a share.

Ehn dis one wey de talk so, no be small wahala o, na before wey be sey don dey worse for di level wey be sey dey now.

American Airlines parent, AMR, and US Air Group, both of dem wey dey do dis one, don give warning of diminish result.

Some analysts no expect quick revival of any takeover by di pilots.

Di deal get, as one takeover expert talk am sey plenty, plenty moving parts.

I no see anybody wey dey sophisticated to get im name for dis mess until di moving parts stop.

In addition to di need for anoda cash equity investor, di oda part wey dey move include di pilots demsef, di machins union, di longtime rivals wey bin sele on top di pilot deal, and di regulators for Washington wey dey oppose di foreign airline investment, come confuse di matter.

In di meantime, arb dey go.

Wall street tradas, and analysts dey estimate sey takeover stock traders, deir stock, and option na as many as 6.5 million share, or about 30% of di total amount wey deir stock get.

Frank Gallagher wey be one analyst for Phoenix Capital Corp, for New York, na im talk sey di arbs dey pay around $280 a share for di UAL.

Dat one go show sey di arbs don lose paper on UAL sey na only $725 million dem get.
