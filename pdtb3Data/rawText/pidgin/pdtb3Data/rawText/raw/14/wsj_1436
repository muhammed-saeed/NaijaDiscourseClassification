Di area wey dey near Alexander Haagen Co, Vermont-Slauson Shopping Centre for Watts, for di area wey dey deteriorate, and true, true, no be di area wey person go choose to go.

But if you enter ehm ehm ehm ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn e

Na only dere e dey safe, and busier.

For di past year, na only one thief, three thief for car, no purse snatch, and one attempted robbery for di mall wey opened for 1981.

Na di same size for shopping centre for one affluent Los Angeles suburb go get eight robbers, 70 robbers, or four robbers.

Watts Mall dey sell more dan three hundred, five hundred, naira per lease foot, di number for adashi-... eh adashi centre na $200.

Three oder Haagen shopping centre for Watts also dey do almost.

One successful low cost mall for high cost area, na im dey make business men, gangs, robbers, ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi ebi o, ebi o, ebi o, ebi o, ebi o, ebi o, ebi o.

Momo and Pop operation don replace big big supermarket wey dey produce poor quality goods at higher price.

Di exodus of shopping opportunity, na im be di labour wey di major shain dey give community people.

So even Vermont Stauson Centre sef, na correct place to shop.

Dis one wey be sey de no dey too enter business zone, for people wey dey stay inside one big house wey no get fence, and for people wey no dey live near am, e dey show sey community dey condition and sey gang dey not invincible.

Di centre improve di image to outsiders, and may be able to arrest, or even reverse di exodus of capital, and investment.

Anoder benefit still dey di creation of job.

Dis one start for di construction phase through minority contractors, and local workers.

Di ting still dey on top di level, di Vermont State Centre don create 500 permanent private sector, one time wey only $2,500 per evriday for public sector.

Many of dis job na from local residents wey dey move from welfare to tax, di $2,500 per eh public investment suppose to repay in a few years.

And dat na before dem go take add state, and local revenue on top sales, real estate, license, and di rest.

Dem still suffer for di community, di nonprofit Vermont-Slauson Economic Development Corp, dem dey collect 60% of di profit from Vermont State Centre, and dem dey use di money dey provide small, small housing for di community. Dem dey run enter hundreds of unit, plus commercial, and industrial projects.

Bradley Crowe, wey be di mayor, City Economic Development Office, na im talk dis one sey: â€œE no get any question wey be sey Vermont strike cause wahala for around di area.

Wetin don happen for one bad area before, na wig, and shoe shop now, na im be sey de don dey upgrade housing, and commercial centre, de don dey tank for one continuous supply of fresh water wey be sey na Vermont slipper dey bring.

Anoder benefit be sey many of di owners for dis centre, na minority business men, and women.

For Grand Boulevard Plaza wey dey for Chicago Third Ward, opposite Robert Taylor Homes, 29% of di store wey dey date date don dey rent to black, and 14% to any oda minority group.

Children from community go get better role model pass drug kingpin.

So wetin be di catch?

Priscilla sey to put one of dis inner city togeder, to put am for one side, to put am for one side, to put am for one side, to put am for one side, to put am for one side, to put am for one side, to put am for one side, to put am for one side.

Security cost too dey very high.

One of dis centres fit involve years of negotiation with many public agencies, local political leaders, and citizen groups, plus prospective tenants, and sources of financing.

Suburban deal no be deir delayed, and complications o, innercity deal just get more of dem.

Security for one typical Haagen inner city center fine well well, but no be true.

E get one high iron gate wey long rish eighty seven and half fit and e get small gate wey dem dey pass enter di main hall.

Di flower and di lokust dey make am fine and fine well-well.

Infrared motion detector, and closed circuit monitor di whole center, light level na three to five times wey di industry standard be.

Di security oga ah, kamp dey on top roof for di building wey dey for di oda building, with Panorama View for di whole centre.

Local law enforcement dey for one sub station wey dey occupy space wey di center don donate.

Dem still dey use am for Matana Remaining Group Grand Boulevard Plaza.

For afternoon, na Haagen get en own big police force wey e dey use and e dey pay workers wey dey work for each centre.

Security dey 60% to 70% of di common area charges of dis centers, vs. An industry average of about 15%.

Dem keep dis one for security because di centre site acquisition, construction, and financing, na im dey reduce di number of programme wey be sey na di Urban Development Grants, Economic Development Grants, Community Development Grants, di free Industrial Development Bond, Enterprise Zone, and tax increment.

Many of dis programme no dey exist again, de don suffer well, well.

But as e be sey dis centre dey pay for demself, noting dey wey go stop state, and local government to enacting legislation with oda similar provision.

Many states don already get Enterprise Zone, and legislation wey dey combine tax, borrow, and grant to encourage investment for depressed areas wit di requirement to hire people wey no get work, and minority.

Dem fit expand dis one to focus on top projects, project planning, identify source of funds, acquire site, dey prepare am.

Bringing in Crime, and fear of it inside inner city, should give Enterprise Zones more success pass most of them now.

E fit be sey di big, big building wey we build for inside town na main road wey we dey pass go market.

New approach to design, and operation to tap dis market.

If di risk and reward dey reasonable, developers go dey answer.

Government people wey dey wonder how important e be sey make dem encourage development for high risk, make dem visit Vermont Slauson, Grand Boulevard Plaza, come decide for demsef.

Di answer go clear.
