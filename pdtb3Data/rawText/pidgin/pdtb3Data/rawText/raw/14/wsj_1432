Cathay Pacific Airways, di smooth ride may end.

Di first wahala wey come out na di Hong Kong carrier wey be Swire Pacific Ltd subsidiary drop 5% for di first six months, come warn sey small wahala go continue for di rest of di year.

Security analyst, many of dem wey scrap deir buy recommendation after see katakata interim figures, believe sey more jolly, more jolly, more jolly.

Fuel, and personnel matter don dey increase, and tourism matter don dey go on top China since di June 4 wey dem kill for Beijing.

Dem still dey delay delivery for di first two of as many as 28 Boeing 747-400 wey be sey de don raise money on top sey de don employ human being to dey come inside di plane.

and sturbon competition for di air force market, dey skata for one big side.

De also concern sey once Hong Kong don revert to China sovereignty for 1997, Cathai go come play second flag for China wey no dey again flag carrier, Civil Aviation Authority of China, or CAAC.

Di sense be sey we no go ever fit do anytin again wey dey work for us like dat before,‚Äù na so Rod Eddington, wey be commercial director, talk.

Sarah Hall, one analyst for James Capel (Farish) Ltd, dey yarn sey e no too dey common for di rising price of jet fuel, Hong Kong tight market, or di strengthening of local currency wey dey close to U.S. dollar.

Di factors further na wetin di airline push to take transform from regional carrier to international one, Ms. Hall talk.

Ms. Hall expect sey di money wey Cathay go carry go up, e go grow like dis year, and next year.

For 1988 e gain $282 billion Hong Kong (US$361.5 million) revenue of HK$11.79 billion.

Catha dey take many step to support business.

One step na to beef up di fleet.

In addition to di aircraft wey dey come from Boeing Co, Cathaya bin announce on top of as many as 20 aeroplane A330 300.

Expanding wey be sey na US$5.7 billion over di next eight years, e go increase di fleet to about 43 plane by 1991 from 30 to di last year according to Sun Hung Kai Securities Ltd.

Di big aeroplane wey get fuel, dem go dey use am take replace all di old aircraft wey dey Lockheed Tristar for regional flights, while di Boeing plane go dey use long Haul to Europe and North America.

Cathay also dey move some of im labour wey be sey im dey do data, dem dey do am outside Hong Kong.

Dem dey sell young people wey dey work for Hong Kong, by 20% a year for low staff, but experienced workers dey leave di colony as part of di brain drain.

Some work don already move to Australia, and plan dey to place oders in Canada.

David Bell wey dey inside di airline talk sey di move na mainly to retaining existing staff wey dey leave to secure foreign passport before di 1997.

Cathai is working to promote Hong Kong as a destination for itself rather than just a stopover.

Even though sey di June 4 wey dem kill for Beijing don affect China flight, Cathaya any oda route don still suffer.

Oga Eddington dey look Hong Kong as one of di main attraction wey dey attract visitors from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, wey plenty people wey dey travel go oda country, don increase.

De also dey speculate sey Catha go dey among di major private private part of di Hong Kong government plan to build new airport, wit di carrier wey be sey e go invest inside im own terminal.

Cathay wey dey inside di hall, de no go comment on top di speculation.

Oga Eddington see alliance with oder carriers, especially di latest joinbody of AMR Corp. American Airlines, as one important part of di strategy of di company.

But e dey yarn sey Cathay no get any interest for swapping equity stake wit di U.S. carrier, or di Lufthansa, di West German airline wey be sey e don dey cooperate wit about ten years.

Analyst people believe sey na on top of a regular basis na im dey carry di matter go, especially as people for Europe dey see am as normal way to take get dia share.

We think alliance very important, Oga Eddington talk sey but we go just carry money put for our own business instead of person own.

I no sure sey person wey get cross, na im go just make tings smooth.

Di pattern wey dey shele be sey as e dey do for some key U.S. destination, na so Cathaya just announce sey e go do for San Francisco wen e dey fly American Airlines Angels Hub, and e dey carry passengers enter U.S. carrier.

But dis one wey be sey we no go do big operation for U.S., and dem no go get big operation like us for Pacific," Oga Eddington talk sey but dis one wey be sey America go do better extension for Boston, New York, Chicago, and Dallas.

We go coordinate on top of dis end to places like Bangkok, Singapore, and Manila.

Asian traffic wey dey account now 65% of Kathathi business, na im go continue as di mainstay.

Cathay don dey long talk sey e want do double of im week for China to 14 and e dey apply make e resume long cancelled flights for Vietnam.

Oga Bell wey dey shook eye inside di matter talk sey more expansion dey happen for south Europe too.

While many Hong Kong company don reopen offshore before 1997, dis move no be option for Cathay because e go separate right for im landing right for Hong Kong.

And Oga Eddington emphatically rule out to London say our lifeblood na Hong Kong traffic right.

E say di airline dey put faith for di Sino-British agreement on top of Hong Kong return to China.

Special section wey dey deal on top aeroplane matter, na im go carry di small one wey be Hong Kong Dragon Airlines go continue to dey negotiate with Hong Kong government.

But critics dey worry sey post-1997 officials, dem go eventually carry am go Beijing.

My feeling be sey kathay no get hope for long run, one analyst wey no gree identify, sey Cathay go like continue, but general sense say de dey go do someting.

Oga Eddington acknowledge sey di carrier go evolve, and adapt to local change, but e feel sey di Sino-British agreement na firm ground to build on for di future wey we dey sure sey e dey protect our route structure, e say and our power to grow and prosper.
