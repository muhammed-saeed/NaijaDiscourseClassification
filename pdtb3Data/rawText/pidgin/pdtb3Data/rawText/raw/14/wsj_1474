Highdefinition television promise to be di TV of tomorrow so na natural multibillion dollar market.

Although major U.S. manufacturers don do all dis one, dem don stop di main segment of dat future to Japan, no be sey everybody for here wan give up.

Some small U.S. companies dey struggle to develop di technology to take dey do di thin, quality television wey dey go on top living room, by di time wey go reach di end of di 1990s.

Di government nko, nko, ni, ni, ni, ni, ni, ni, ni, ni, ni, ni, ni, ni, ni, ni, ni, ni, ni, ni, ni, ni, ni, ni, ni.

Photonics Technology Inc, of Northwood, Ohio, wan use one new technology take do film show wey dey 30 inches (as e dey 30 inches) inside one frame.

Planar Systems Inc, of Beaverton, ore, di largest of dis firm, with $20 million in annual revenue, na im dey also plan.

E don succeed for electroluminescence already, anoder promising technology come out for high definition television.

Two oder firms, Ovonic Imaging Systems Inc, of Troy, Michael, and Magnascreen Corp. of Pittsburgh dey develop one kind flat screen wey dem dey call active matrix liquid crystal.

New technology wan retire cathode-ray tube wey be sey na most of di conventional TV set.

Replacing di cathode-ray tube with big, big screen, na im dey key to di creation of high definition television, or HDTV wey be sey na 30 billion e go get inside di whole world within ten years.

Large U.S. company dey interested in oder part for di HDTV wey be sey na dem be signal processing, and broadcast equipment.

But except Zenith Electronics Corp, and International Business Machine Corp, wey be sey dey do computer display, de dey slow down for small, big panel.

General Electric Co, recently, e sell im business give Thompson-CSF for France sey we don find di market no dey develop as we tink sey e go be, one GE spokesperson talk.

Small U.S. firm dey push on top dia strong position for patent, and because di prize still dey dere, dem never fit seize di panel wey dey come out for commercial cost, Zvi Yaniv wey be Ovonic Imaging talk.

E say im tink sey na just some years im company dey do dat one.

Bush administration, when dem dey hear conflict advice about wetin im suppose do for HDTV, e no do much for dem now.

Di only material support wey e dey stretch to di struggling U.S. industry, na 30 million awards from Pentagon's Defence Advanced Research Agency.

DARPA money na koko compare wetin Japan, and oder prospective competitor dey spend.

Di Commerce Department talk sey, di way Japan government dey spend for HDTV research, e don pass one billion.

Peter Friedman, wey be photonics executive vice president, talk sey if e no help, di U.S. industry no go get chance again.

So far, almost all di basic technology wey concern high definition television don come from U.S. laboratories.

But Peter Brody, wey be Magnascreen president, talk sey Japan company don dey prepare to snatch di technology, come put am for commercial use, just as dem do with previous U.S. innovations for colour television, and video recording.

For 1970, Oga Brody come develop di first panel wey stand on top active matrix liquid crystal for Westinghouse Electric Corp. Research lab for Pittsburgh.

Di panels be like oversized semiconductor wey get one million or more pictin, each of dem dey contribute to di colour, and tone of di TV image.

But for 1979, Westinghouse abandon the project with its stake for advanced television.

Mr. Brody comot for di company go find oder backers.

E get right to sell Westinghouse patent, but e dey claim sey na many Japan person dey carry di patent give dem.

Most American investors just surrender, Oga Brody talk sey de no ready to contest for di area wey Japan wan enter.

Michael Kelly wey be di director of DARPA medical office, don yarn o sey di industry need for federal support, Pentagon just dey announce on top national security matter sey, we no see domestic source for some of our hdTV requirement, and na source of concern we dey.

So DARPA dey try to keep sey di industry dey interested in big, big panel wey be sey de dey do research fund.

DTV don get some military application like make person take dey do simulation, dey carry information go give di commanders.

Navy dey order Aegis cruisers make dem do am, but army wan make dem do am small, so dat dem go fit do am small.

Di Commerce Department too dey push on top of HTV because of di benefit wey e fit carry on top of di semiconductor, and computer technology, na no be just yuppie television o, na di director of di department office of microelectronis and instrumentation na im be sey di industry go take dey display display for work station, and medical diagnostics, before e go get mass consumer market.

Although some HDTV advocate dey call for oder kind aid like antitrust relief for research consortia, di small firm firm go just prefer more DARPA fund.

Everybody dey claim to get di right technology, and na just shikini money dem wan take do business.

De also wan U.S. to dey do business, dey reflect on top of Pentagon, and Commerce Department gben sey de dey concern dem future.

All of dem dey vex for one petition wey some Japan TV company (matsushita, Hitachi, and Toshiba) dey drop for portable television wey get liquid tins wey U.S. don put for di big Japanese TV wey dem dey sell.

And de wan U.S. to help dem sell overseas.

Planted by James Hurd say e go pay tax as high as 15% for im display panel for Japan and South Korea, while panel from di countries dey enter U.S. duty free.

Dis no be technology issue, but attitude issue, e say we never learn wetin e take dey contest.
