Dallas Cowboys dey look one long yardage situation, dey struggle dey push Atlanta Falcons go front.

For im stadium box, dia new, and controversial owner, Jerral Jaerry Jones, dey dere dey worry as di team dey go di scrimmage line.

Mr. Jones get heart.

De centre of di pack na Troy Aikman wey be di key to di Cowboys comeback strategy.

So key in fact sey Oga Jones sign am for April for $11.4 million ah for di next six years ah a record for rookie, na real Wheati-box athlete o, gushes.

Oga God, with three minutes left for clock, Oga Aikman carry di snap, step back, fire a 21 yard pass, straight enter di hand of one Atlanta defensive back.

Di crowd groan, Oga Jones don shake head, Cowboy lose di game.

After some days after dat Sept. 17 ball, Oga Aikman break finger, go dey sideline am for weeks.

Ah di glamour of professional sports.

For dis year wen be sey Oga Jones lose im referee, na only di latest setback wey don set for Dallas Cowboys, and dis year, na im many pass for National Football League.

Once e fat, and happy, cowboys now dey lose ball, fans, and money.

Last year, di team finish $2 million in di red on top 30 million in revenue.

E get some of di highest money wey dey di league.

Di number na 23% from di six years wey don pass.

At least, Oga Jones wey be di society circuit overseer as e dey vex for im bench, fit dey happy for one fact, sey dis days, no be only im dey.

Nearly half of di owners of di 28 national football team dey lose money, because of deir attend, aging stadium, and oder tings wey be sey na evritin for star players like Oga Aikman.

Last year, di top 12 players wey dey each team carry average of $536,000, wey be sey dey play ball pass basketball.

Art model wey be Cleveland Browns, na im don do di first round of draft pick even better, di average salary and bonus wey dem dey collect from dem na $685,000 per year, up to 44% from 1987. Art model wey be oga for Cleveland Browns, talk sey one team dey pay so, and di oda one dey pay pass.

We no just get dat kind income stream.

All dis one dey cause convulsion for professional football.

Women wey dey do business, before, dem dey do am small, small, dey find how dem go take reduce cost, raise revenue, and e go be like sey na some kind innovation dey do am.

Though not intentionally, di Cowboys' oga don come represent dis new owner.

Shortly after dem buy 66% of di team from H.R.Bum (Bum) bright for $145 million, and mindful of di Cowboys tear rubber, di 47 years old Oga Jones tear rubber for im own team.

E first sack Tom Landry wey be di legendary coach wey carry di Cowboys go five Super Bowls and 20 consecutive season.

For Dallas, Oga Landry just dey shy of sainthood.

Anti-Jones sentiment burst for local press one crude hick, one person write, real oink, anoda person, who in hell e tink sey e be, write di third one.

For Mr. Jones, na just di beginning.

E sharperly cut di team administrative staff by half, shutting down one cowboys dance academy, and for July, e announce plans to sell Valley Ranch, di team's thirty-acre training camp, and di most expensive training facility for NFL. Oga Jones call di ranch di Pentagon of Sportsdom, di place wey dey connect film room, better spas, better massage centre, and more free condition.

E dey like talk to di people how im lost on top one expansion ranch during one early visit, con run go one office, call front desk for help, I say person come collect me.

I dey extension 29. ‚Äù

Wit a new day for di sport, Oga Jones no see place for dis kind luxuries, e just no cost.

Di place cost almost $2 million a year to maintain.

When e sell am, e dey talk sey cowboys go move to a more practical ting o, grass practice field near Texas Stadium.

And for Tom Landry, for Oga Jones mind, im don play ball win many years.

After we don postpone season for each of di last three years, di Cowboys need to change.

Football don tay o for Oga Jones passion, both for di field, and for di field.

One Arkansas native, im start to dey guard on top di undefeated 1964 Arkansas team wey win national championship.

After university, e work for im papa insurance company for Little Rock, and for 1966 e come go buy San Diego Chargers.

After some years, with money wey dem dey sell for insurance company, e start Arcoma Production Corp, one oil, and gas exploration company wey dey inside Little Rock.

So no be sey na Oga Jones come back to im Arkansas roots when e go look for replacement for Oga Landry.

Dem appoint Jimmy Johnson as teammate for di 1964 University of Arkansas squad and di head coach for University of Miami wey e carry Hurricane go five winning season and national championship for 1987.

No matter wetin Mr. Johnson do, for many Dallas fans heart, im no be Tom Landry.

Seven games (and after I lose to Kansas City chiefs yesterday, seven lose) for di season, di new kob boy no dey do any better ting pass di old one.

In fact di last time wey de play dis one well, well, na for 1960 de dey open season.

De admit say de admit about 49,000 last year for deir games.

Oga Jones dey enter one kind wahala for front.

E continue to reshuffle di team as e dey sell fame, come run back Herschel Walker come Minnesota Vikings dis month ah of players and future draft pickin.

To try to attract more fans, im don drop end zone ticket price from $25 to $19.

But general trend, rising cost for league don dey push price, and na Mr. Jones na im go later follow suit. Lamar Hunt wey be oga for Kansas City chiefs, and last year na im get ticket price of $2.40 to anoda $17.

Oga Jones don also beef up im marketing staff to sell di 118 luxury suites wey dey top Texas Stadium, e deal wit Bum Bright include sey im get operating rights for di stadium.

All of dem dey airconditioned, get bar, seating, view di field, all of dem dey sell di price of $475,000 to $1 million akordin to di size and where dem dey stay.

Mr. Jones don dey carry prospective owners enter field when e dey practice to dey use hand rub elbow wit players, and promise wey dey buy one of di rooms, wey dey inside di team plan before di game.

Di sales work be like sey e dey pay off, when e buy di team, na only six of di suite we don sell since.

Today, 30 don do.

Gratitude receipt na only cowboys second oga patapata.

Di biggest one na di contract wey dey inside di league with national television for broadcast of di league games.

Last year, di cowboys share of dat pie reach $17.6 million.

Di team also dey collect between $2 million, and $4 million for local radio, and television rights.

Oga Jones now, e dey compare local rights price to price.

E dey also try to get more station for Mexico wey di Cowboys get following to carry di games.

Mr. Jones wey im talk, and people wey dey do jibiti, one business man wey dey work for 16 hours, e don resign to di plenty, plenty money wey e dey pay im players dis days.

E call di contract critical to win for di NFL and e don play im part for di Bidding War.

In addition to signing Mr. Aikman to sizable contract, Mr. Jones don gree to pay former Super Falcon, Steve Walsh $4.1 million ah for di next four years.

Dis money wey be sey de dey pay dey damage NAFDAC dry wey be sey deir owner dey drag.

Small time, na only big corporations go fit buy, and run football team, according to John J. Veatch Jr., one investment banker wit Salomon Brothers wey handle Cowboy sell.

To tackle di wahala, NFL owners don propose to set a rookie wage rate wey go fit rein-... dey pay.

Di details of di plan wey go happen for 1993 dey sketch, but dem go give each player base salary akordin to di level wey e be and how e go be.

Knotling time, and performance, na im go dey pay you.

Meanwhile, di NFL Players Association dey drag sey dem dey pay athletes better wit dia skill to draw fans, and sey some owners dey suffer for poor business management, no be people salary we dey collect.

Di owner demsef dey try to make gain for oder ways too.

Many don start promotions to attract new fans, and dem dey renegotiating stadium contract.

Most of di owners must pay up to 10% of gross ticket sales on top stadium wey dem talk sey e dey too small, or e too old.

For Chicago, for example, na size di issue dey.

Wi get di worst lease wey dey inside di NFL, according by Michael B. McCaskey wey be di president of di Chicago Bear, and grandson of George Halas wey be di NFL presido organization, we dey inside metro area with many, many bear fans, and na only few people fit stay inside. When di lease expire for 1999, e say e get to be changed.

Dis year, di NFL still put 80 players limit for teams wey dey enter training camp, down from 120 for one move wey be sey dem go dey trim payroll.

And di league dey try get more for im three years national network contract wey expire after dis season.

Di current contract dey pay di NFL $1.4 billion.

Wiwners talk sey de dey expect di league to increase despite di fact sey televised football no get any rank.

Anoda person wey dey inside di league also yarn sey di league go maybe expand im offer to cable TV company like ESPN.

Di changes no easy o.

Like professional football, dis NFL organization sef dey for turmoil.

Di new breed of team owner, Oga Jones, na im don dey fight di NFL bureaucracy on top sey na one kain ball matter, and di fight don cause organization problem.

For July, 11 NFL owners, almost all of dem new, dem block one attempt to put Jim Finks as replacement for di supplementary league commissioner wey be Pete Rozelle.

Mr. Finks na oga for one man wey sabi work well-well for Old Guards.

Earlier dis month, anoda attempt to choose a commissioner fail.

Owners dey meet again tomorrow.

En own part, Jerry Jones talk sey na e dey do business for long haul, and im work style be sey e dey support dat one.

He put on top busy six days (excluding game days), and on top one recent afternoon field questions, in di course of one hour, from one TV producer, im luxury marketing manager, one disgruntled customer, one roomful Arkansas reporters.

To continue im plan, e fly two personal secretaries from Little Rock to add join im staff for Dallas.

When I do dis investment, I do am on a lifetime basis, e con talk sey I no dey here to make money by resell di team later on.

While cowboy fit no be di best investment now, I no accept sey e fit no dey for future.

Apart from sey to some extent, Oga Jones don dey get wetin im wan leave for di team o, even dough sey di team no dey win.

Cowboys don buy am enter glitzy life wey be sey oil for Arkansas no just provide.

E get di new private jet, di paloon of assistant, invitation to di best party, and television appearance on top show like sey na few weeks ago, Oga Jones even entertain Elizabeth Taylor for im private suite for Texas Stadium.

E say you dey inside di catbird seat every day for dis job.
