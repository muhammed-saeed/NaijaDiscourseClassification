OPEC don get power to produce more oil wey e no fit sell o, e don begin dey mark mark for world oil market.

Di Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries don dey hot for di year and most member nations dem don dey run.

But industry, and OPEC people dey gree sey some members still get di capacity wey no reach dem take dey make market, come make oil price come down small, small month from now if OPEC no gree for new quota system to corrupt di chronic cheaters.

Because of dis one, some oil ministers go don dey drag for OPEC to approve new permanent production agreement next month.

Dem suppose do meeting for Vienna starting November 25.

So far dis year, some members don dey price well, well even dough sey na big mistake de dey cheat on top some oda members.

But dat one fit change if you dey find OPEC oil make e dey soft well, well early next year as some people dey tink am.

OPEC don produce more than 22 million hey o, e don dey produce more than 22 million hey o, on top of di yama, yama wey dey inside di fourth quarter ceiling of 20.5 million according to OPEC people and industry people for one oil convention wey di Oil Daily and di International Herald Tribune dey sponsor.

Dat rate, most of OPEC 13 members don get deir output, dem say.

But dem say at least three million barrel a day, and maybe seven million barrel a day, spare capacity still dey inside OPEC.

Most of dem dey concentrate for five Persian Gulf countries including im own, Issam Al-Chalabi, Iraq oil minister, e tell di conference on Friday.

E dey give OPEC capacity of 28 million to 29 million hey oda day.

Dat one high pass some oder estimates.

Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, Kuwait oil minister, newly estimated OPEC don reach 25 million barrel a day.

Anyhow e be, di big house wey dey on-top di wall, big rish to keep pure olive oil market.

Even if doz wey get big, big power, like Saudi Arabia, and Iraq take measure, e fit spoil market.

Iraqi oil minister, and Saudi oil minister, Hisham Nazer inside di yarn o sey deir country go act responsibly to maintain stable market.

But for interview later, both ministerial go don yarn sey dem dey expect make OPEC wey go dey ground mainly on top of di load wey be sey de don produce, and reserve of each member.

Dat approach, countries wey no get fully oil capacity go get big share of any future increase for oEC production ceiling pass wetin dey now, sey if you dey produce at 95%, or na 100% of your capacity, wetin you go fit produce at 105%? Oga Al-Shalabi don talk.

For one exclusive meeting wey last month, OPEC people don approve half of wetin dem dey do on top one million barrel a day for deir production ceiling.

Dem do am out with di old formula wey be sey even countries wey no fit produce more people, de still do am out with di higher official support.

Di main effect of di ceiling increase na to "legitimate" some of di overproduction already dey come from di quota cheaters.

Still, e get one change wey happen for Geneva.

Before dis time, no OPEC member don ever agree to reduce evritin wey dey di group output, or ceiling.

But di ministerial servants dey generally use disproportionate quota for people wey no get power.

At di end, politics come enter road.

Libya accept Iran proposal only as dem promise am sey e go produce parity wit Kuwait.

And United Arab Emirates, one chronic quota cheater, e no gree guarantee sey e go change im way.

But di oil ministers still dey study di plan, and maybe na di basis for discussion next month.

Sey na many, many compromise don already come into di plan.

Di ceiling go be 21.5 million barrels to provide Kuwait, and di United Arab Emirates go get big, big quota wey go reduce wetin some go get.

Libya before, no be wahala again o, but United Arab Emirates still get wahala.

Saudi Arabia, OPEC kingpin sef don show as possible wahala, some OPEC people yarn.

Di 24.5% increase on top any ceiling, Saudi goment don long on top di pro rata increase on top all member.

But for Geneva, de bin comot from di OPEC wey be sey na only 5.3 million barrels per day from five million.

Some of di proposed changes since den, call on top Saudi Arabia say give back to di production pool na 23,000 barrels.

Though small, dat ting go reduce share.

Mr. Nazer wey be Saudi oil minister, na im dey yarn here sey di kingdom go insist on top of OPEC wey dey produce under any quota, under any condition, Saudi Arabia go get more, instead of less.
