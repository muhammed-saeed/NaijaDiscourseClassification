Bakersfield Supermarket comot for business last May.

Di reason no be high intrest, and labour cost.

No shortage of customer dey di area, di residential inwood section for northern Manhattan.

“Di business klose wen robbers kill di owner.

Di pesin wey get di land na Israel Ortiz wey get 29 years and e get two pipol.

For di first year wey e buy two hundred and twenty thousand, Oga God, dem robber am at least times for gunpoint.

Di first time wey dem shoot am for hand, as e pursue di robbers outside.

Di second time e identify two robbers, wey dem catch and charge o.

After two weeks, maybe in retaliation, dem shoot am three times back during wetin police classified as third robbery attempt.

Na im gain im work be sey e do am till eleven p.m. seven days a week to take cover im $3,000 monthly rent.

Wetin im customer talk na very personal work and e dey help well well.

Dey put mind for area life.

Israel Ortiz na only one out of di thousands entrepreneurs and di people wey dey work for am wey dey injure or kill for dis year.

Di U.S. Bureau of Justice statistics talk sey almost 2% of all retail workers dey suffer from crime every year, na almost double di national average, na about four times di rate wey dem dey pay for teachers, truck drivers, doctor and door to door people, na almost di same.

Some oder occupation, na only few oda occupation don get higher, higher tori of criminal injury, like police, bartender, taxi drivers.

But dis figures show only di part wey big pass for di wahala.

New York Times add some oda pictures.

While by no means di highest crime community for di country, New York na one example of city wey be sey crime dey skata small business development.

Dem do one small business wey dem dey call Interface, one policy research organization.

Question wey dem share give 1,124 business, and dem use am talk 353 answer.

Dem talk sey dem rob people wey dey work, wey dey work, wey dey work, dem rob people wey dey work for three years period 22%.

Seventeen percent of di report dey report sey dem dey rob deir customers.

Na badness dey make 26% of di report wey dey bring recruitment, and 19% say de dey reason to dey move.

More than one out of evry three businesses wey dey go on top di matter say dem dey suffer from ogogoro and dey loiter near dia premises.

For Brooklyn, and Bronx, one out of four commercial firms dey tief out every year.

Road too much, e even worse o, double of di citywide average.

Small business wey dem dey do dey kill am pass big business.

Two decades ago, Small Business Administration talk sey Yale Prof.

Albert Reiss boundary study of crime against 2,500 small businesses wey dey inside National Recet Records.

E see sey di money wey dem take dey collect from people, na 37 times e take buy small business pass big one.

New York company dey average of 27 people wey dey work, di average na about $15,000, with additional $8,385 for security, wey be sey de dey hire at least one more worker.

Killing of something may be enough to destroy a struggling business.

No matter how monetary crime take cause, e fit no dey important for entrepreneurs as per person wey get injury.

After repeated gun robbery, some entrepreneurs fit give up dia business because of fear for dia life.

One Washington couple just sell deir liquor store after 34 years inside business wey be sey na four robbery, 16 robbery, or thief, de dey inside di house.

Dis one wey we talk so, show di vicious cycle wey di National Institute of Justice director James K. Stewart dey call crime causing poverty, underclassement, small work opportunities, dey contribute to di poverty of local residents.

Small business wey dey small fit provide more job if no be to just create and maintain di business.

Dis one go help dem explain why small business dey bring 65% of all di work for di country, but na only 22% of di job for bad, bad, bad city like New York.

Big business sometimes better fit reduce crime.

The New York Times talk sey the money wey dem dey pay for firm firm, wey no pass five people, na almost $1,000 per person wey dey work, with one out of evry three wey dey work, and 10 people wey dey work.

When e be sey business no too dey again, dem come dey sell for big big business centre, sotay e come dey sell small, big business centre.

Priscilla and moonlighting police fit use di law of trespass to regulate access to dis quasi public place.

Since 1984, in fact, di 10 biggest guard company revenue don increase by almost 62%.

But di small, small business wey dey di area fit get like dat, even if na local business dem dey do am.

Area wey deir crime high, small business generally dey rely on public police force to protect demself.

Dis one dey cause for many wahala.

One be sey police no dey enough to satisfy small business.

Di number one proposal to reduce crime for New York, na to put more police on top of foot or okada patrol, e suggest more than two third of di people wey dey give di report.

Na only 22% dem dey support private security patrol wey dem dey fund by demself.

Di second wahala na when person no quick vex on top fake alarm wey fit make police no dey happy to dey respond to small business call.

Na only half of the New York small businesses wey dem don check, for their own part, di police response wey dem dey give dem, de dey satisfy dem.

Some city like New York don experiment with special tax district for commercial area wey dey give extra patrol wey local business people dey pay.

But dis one add money to urban entrepreneurship.

Anoder solution wey you go see, na to dey do special priority for police to dey patrol small, small business area.

If you dey sell am for any of the city wey dey near major shopping centre, na better business investment e be to help people wey dey sell and sell tax inside di city.

Increase of ehm ehm ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn.

Wit the National Institute of Justice support, Minneapolis police and di Crime Control Institute, na im dey currently compare wetin dey happen to such strategy with traditional random patrolling.

Small business patrol na very good gesture anytime wey small business person suppose testify against robbery suspect.

While not guarantee, increased police presence fit even make more attacks.

Ortiz family for Israel fit don save dia life and evritin wey dem get.

Mr. Sherman na professor of criminology for University of Maryland, and president of Crime Control Institute for Washington, D.C.E.
