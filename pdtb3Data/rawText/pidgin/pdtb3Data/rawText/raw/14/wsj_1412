E dey very clever of Robert Goldberg to use di form of fake advocacy journalism take explain im view of "Days of Rage" for inside im television critique (Leisure & Arts, Sept 11).

Hestises Jo Franklin-Trout for her inept presentation of advocacy journalism, judging her project as e dey slip well, well.

One example wey e give, e no ask (why e be sey di Palestinian children na soldiers wey dey throw stone).

Very soon now, she don go ask?

No be di picture, and di ting wey dey happen for inside di tori, na im de still dey answer?

Mr. Goldberg even as sey even as sey na "propaganda", di film no dey come out because na only one view.

No be sey Palestinian people dey complain about di treatment wey dem dey do, of course Israel people dey suffer.

But im complain say day of Rage no get balanced comment from Israel people on how badly di Palestinian people dey behave.

E be like sey you do one documentary on top apartheid, and you dey insist sey equal time dey go for where wonderful, wonderful Oyinbo people dey.

Dis film show how long Israel, palestinian tori person don dey since when dem carry di quarrel reach di days of World War I when British gree sey one Jew state, and one Palestinian state no tell us how dem go do am.

Well, days of Rage dey air wit before, and after packaging, and after repeated delays.

Every issue na multisided.

Dis film wey wan show one side wey we never see for media before.

Now we must endure some kind criticism wey be sey de wan know only one side.

Salaam.

Shaalom.
