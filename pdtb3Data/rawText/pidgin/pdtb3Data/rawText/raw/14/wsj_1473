:.START

First na di somewhat affected idea about di 1960s.

Den di whole kommunity for di world go start to dey rule from 1970 go rish 1980.

For wetin now?

To judge novel wey mirror di present scene, we don back in di age of anxiety.

Where 60 people wey be sey de dey profesai give sharbon, yuzles, yuzles, yuzles, yu dey look am far, far now e be like sey many people don dey fall between cracks, na so-so yeye life full dat middle.

Lisa Zeidner third novel, namely di 'Liminis Partnerships' (North Point Press, 256 page, $18.95) na one kind fine, funny ting to see as e dey affect love relationship, or more especially sey di lack of am.

Nora Worth and Malcolm Dewitt na three and 39. Dem dey stay for one house wey dey where dem dey call Philadelphia wey be the main town.

Malcom wey be one former film maker before, wey dey architect before, just see im first chance for one lucrative commission wey turn sand sand into sand for im ogbonge client wey be real estate developer ah.

Noora wey still get artistic aspiration, know sey e dey lucky as she take dey do hairdressing, prepping pies, burgers, cold drinks, and oder kain tins to just dey appert di camera.

After all, she con dey reason sey housewife dey dere wit Nokia, and degree from cooking school for France wey go kill for her work, but Nora and Malcolm feel trapped.

E be like sey de dey get di wuna of di world, artistic work wey no dey do artwork, no dey control di finish product, no dey do self-work wey no dey sweet, or sweet.

Na downbeat, na thirty something, in which bright, young people dey engage in a smooth, smooth day labour, dey do free lair, dey do semi, professional work wey dey make little joy, or security, but sey de know sey de dey thank for di work wey de do.

Every dog dey die.

Malcom face bankruptcy, and one IRS audit o, but Nora see extra money wey be sey e take dey collect from her bank account, e just increase am to fifteen times.

While she dey wonder whether to live am up, and do someting wey dey even bigger, say to marry, her life dey tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay tay.

Some of the story wey dey back of olden days be sey David get wahala, wahala, madam, placard, middle class security.

Di iron wey dey dis novel be sey no man represent "safe", middle class", di way Nora take talk am na between emotional, emotional, and economic base for any country.

Di characters dey confront world wey be sey e dey hard now to see world wey dey between success, failure, wealth, poverty.

Ms. Zeidner make sure sey im and Malcolm and Nora dey among the fine fine specimens wey dey for class and generation.

Di tori be sey no heart (even di characters own) dey bleed for inside light of health matter.

But people wey dey read am fit dey feel am.

Anyhow di tori be sey no be only di main people wey dey inside trouble, or wey dey provide material for fiction, sey na only dem wey be sey dey provide, sey na only dem wey be sey dey provide, sey dey provide, sey na only one person wey be sey na consultant, and business analyst, Joseph Garber, na im dey yarn di story of one new, better, better company wey dem dey call Pegasys as e dey face one hostile attempt by AIW, one small company wey be sey na incompetent take manage to manage.

Patrician wey be dynamic Scott Thatcher, wey be the founder and head of Pegasys, first see the wahala wey go soon end.

But, as e, and im team just discover, dem dey face two tings wey be sey na one business, one one wey be sey dey fail company, with small amount of money, and many naira, dey borrow from di kain bank wey be sey de wan collect, sey de wan collect money take finance di takeover, second, sey for front of AiW, sey na big company wey be sey de sharge on top di matter dey supply money, and muscle take am.

Mr. Garber take invest dis story of financial war wit di colourful characters, and di speedy action of suspense novel.

And like one spy or mystery story, dis novel get strong elements of di tins wey dey worry di good and bad forces.

Mr. Garber dey use big brush stroke wey dey make person do good for God eye. Sometimes, e dey fall go reach where dem dey call caricature.

Won tandard issue of flaky Californians, snobish homosexuals, and Neanderthal union, de undermine di way di author dey feel.

But di swod wey di swod get, get pawa well-well for one book wey dem dey koll Aiw, but if dem nor koll di pesin wey dey lead Aiw, we nor go too worry weda e go win di fight or not.

Ms. Rubin na free time writer wey dey live for Los Angeles.
