Di comments na di ministry first detailed statement on top di matter and dem dey reflect on top di ministry statement sey foreigners go think sey Japan dey use di huge financial power take dey control wetin dey happen for di foreign market.

Many accounts wey lead to di 190 point drop of New York Stock price on Oct. 13 accusate di ministry of pulling di plug on top of di UALUAL cause of one tin or anoda one.

In general, Oga Utsumi talk sey Japan bank don dey become deir own independence for dem to dey approach overseas deal.

Every Japan bank don deir own judgement on top di profits, and risk for dat UAL deal, e say de don dey independent.

E get one sound phenomenon, Sanwa Bank Ltd, one Japan bank wey no gree take part for di first UAL proposal.

But, Oga Utsumi fit don dey hard o, dey convince market people wey dey right, or dey wrongly believe sey di ministry na im dey orchestrat some kind waka wey dey happen for Japan.

Also, analysts dey point out sey Japanese banks dey chop chop wey no dey very profitable if dem wan build share, cement one important business relationship, or curry favour with powerful bureaucrats.

E clear sey some financial authorities dey worry on top sey na Japan bank dey do am to get out, and to get out money.

For one news conference dis week, Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita come give strong mind say make dem take agriment on top highly leveraged deal.

Despite Mr. Sumita statement, na Finance Ministry na im dey do policy decision.

While recent events wey be sey dey cool some of di leveraged buy out fever, Japan no go fit waka comot for di game.

Despite di risk, di deal fit be one attractive way wey Japan go take increase im presence for di U.S. market, bank analysts dey yarn.

Fuel price for home, but with less customers wey dey borrow, leading banks dey ready to expand overseas.

Jumping on top big deals na one way wey you go take leapfrog on top sey you no get strong retail network.
