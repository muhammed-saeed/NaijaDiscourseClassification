Minute afta stock market close Friday, I call Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey advise am sey di Dow Jones Industrial Average don drop by 190 point late dat afternoon, and e dey happy sey im and im fellow Democrats dey guilty.

Dem don do one major setback dat afternoon to President Bush's capital gain tax, wey bin dey inside di Senate afta e don pass di Tabanako last month.

Sen. Bradley get mind say dat kind tax wey go reduce how e take dey do tax wen e dey help engineer for 1986.

But e know sey as many as 20 of im fellow Democrats dey vote for di cut wey popular among deir constituent.

As a result, e argue say make dem block di cut on top procedural basis.

E help persuade 10 of dis senators to support am, and Majority Leader, George Mitchell on dis grounds.

Di budget reconciliation wit October 15 deadline, and dis Senate Democrats no gree allow vote to append capital gain to di budget, after dem know sey e go pass.

Di vote on top substance, na im di RP leadership for Senate on Friday morning confronted with one kind hard choice.

E fit enter di towel, and hope sey na capital gain late dis month, or e fit follow di White House strategy na to vex for di capital gain unless sey dem appunt am.

U.S. Chamber of Commerce don dey push o to support di Bush proposal.

E don endorse Oyinbo strategy, believe sey na di best way to win am.

On Monday, one senior white man adviser Richard Rahn wey be di Chamber chief economist, na im talk sey Oyinbo no go gree for budget reconciliation bill unless sey e go give firm assurance sey de go allow for Senate.

After two hours, di first word come out on top of di Capitol Hill say administration don gree to reconcile wit no such assurance from Senate Democrat.

Mr. Rahn con dey shock, dey telefoy di office of Richard Darman, wey be di Director of Management and Budget, and di administration oga strategist on top dis matter.

E leave one message wey accuse Oga Darman of selling out.

But na Senate rebears na im don dodge from di veto strategy.

Di stock market resign na Oga Rahn do, scatter as e take dey hear sey na Oga Darman plan don fail.

Di stock market, after all, na im dey measure how di future income stream wey be di nation capital market go be, e discounted to di current value.

Why e go sopraiz people say 30% increase for capital gain go affect how much the government capital get?

Di total wey deir hand dey inside, e dey cheap pass $15 billion.

Di money wey de sell near three billion naira.

If di money wey be sey de dey buy am na times two, e nor go fit buy am back wey be sey na di owner of di house dey buy am?

E no make sense to assume sey di asset wey you get go sell am, if government suddenly talk sey if you sell am, you go get 30% gain pass wetin you believe before?

True, na constant increase for stock market since last year wey Presido Bush don succeed to lift im capital gains proposal.

30% increase inside dis year capital gain alone to around $50 billion.

We dey talk real money.

When Richard Rahn advise di financial press sey di market crash na because of di big back up capital gain, de no dey take am play, dey laugh am anyhow.

Instead, press body accept sey na snag wey dey inside di takeover financing of United Airlines dem just carry down 7% of wetin dey di country capital stock, and na so-so convulsion everywhere for di world.

Oga Rahn dey point anoda elephant dey fly for wall but normal wisdom con dey fast for di UAL flight.

Why dis one dey happen?

One tin, many of di leaders wey dey talk for Wall Street, no be portfolio manager o, sey e dey affect how government dey take dey pay di money wey dem carry.

Dem be economists, and financial reporters wey dey sympathise wit di view sey capital gain tax, na im dey make people rich.

But somehow dem talk sey Wall Street no dey gree reduce tax wey be sey na Friday morning na im dem dey rush go and na now wahala.

Market bin bounce Monday, following weekend assurance from Oga Darman say administration get oder plans to win di cut wey dey alive, and well.

Sey en, Bradley argument na sey capital gain go be bad ting for di economy in di long run.

E go inevitably lead to increase in marginal income tax rate for 1990, e dey tink when Oyinbo go ask for higher, higher tax to meet budget.

Dat one na plus capital gain gain, dem go cut di 1986 accord, and political reality go reduce di tax.

Di counter-argument wey e don hear, na sey if im and im fellow Democrats succeed to kill on top di Presido proposal, na di revenue gap go up well, well for 1990 because of di weak economy.

For dis atmosphere, no how much tax go dey come out.

If Sen. Bradley allow allow capital gain, but e go pass, Christmas market go strong, instead of falling stock market, di 1990 economy go get increase, plus di revenue wey go reach any government, even New York own, go high well, well.

Make una nor add tax join.

Di fight on top capital gain na di biggest ball wey dey town.

For Washington and Wall Street.

Mr. Wanniski na president of Polyconomics Inc, of Morristown, N.J.
