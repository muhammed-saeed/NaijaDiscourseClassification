Dem fit stop to dey fall on top I880?

Dat na di question wey di structural engineer, and California transportation oga, dey ask demsef sey na yesterday na im di rescue workers start di tear-tear task to remove as many as 250 victims from under di concrete slab of Nimitz Freeway wey dey for Oakland wen Tuesday shutdown start.

After we don travel go di area, California Gov. George Deukmejian late yesterday wen e call for inquiry on top freeway collapse, e come dey drop rubbish on top subsidy project na im Associated Press bin report.

Di road wey dem dey pass enter di main road na 2.5 mile and e nor get who fit waka am.

But e still get oda tings wey be sey e go bring, e go bring, e go bring, e go bring, e go bring, e go bring, e go bring, e go bring, e go bring, e go bring, e go bring, e go bring, e go bring, e go bring.

E fit be like two years before di well travel artery wey connect Oakland with San Francisco, and di cost wey you go build new stretch of highway fit reach over $250 million, according to Charles J. O'connell, Deputy Director for Los Angeles, wey be Caltrans.

Caltrans for Sacramento say total damage from di collapsed highway na around $500 million.

Di afterjas for di highway accident dey reverberate for Los Angeles as local politicians yesterday talk sey dem no go do doubledecking for Los Angeles anyhow by 1994.

Caltrans wan add second building for bus, and motor park wey dey above di space of 2.5 mile from di Harbor Freeway wey dey south of Los Angeles near Memorial Coliseum.

For October dis year, Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn don begin dey fight di double construction wey dey happen for di area.

Caltrans don leave doubledecking for di 1970s following di 1971 Sylmar earthquake wey destroy freeway for Los Angeles, Oga O'Connor explain.

Di emblem wey dey di Tabanako na 6.1 on top di Richter scale, Tuesday na im dey dere.

So why even dey stack freeways now? We don run comot for place sey we go build freeways for L.A., and di only place wey we go go na L.A. O connell talk sey although e con even acknowledge sey e get many, many hurdles including money.

But e still talk sey na double wall we go use today build am. Di wall wey dey near di wall wey strong well-well, naim dem go use take build am. Di wall go high rish 7.5 metres (as e dey go) and na so too e go high rish 8 metres.

Dat yesterday, dem draw drawings on top di collapse of Nimitz Freeway.

But most of dem wey be engineer talk sey di thing wey cause di accident, na when dem no repair am, and di fact sey di ground under di highway na mostly landfill, and can become unstable, or liquefy for major quake.

Two story building wey dem build for di middle of di 1940 â€™ s and wey finish for 1957 na two story building dey on top of one building wey dem dey use steel build for di highway today.

While di pillars get long metal bars wey dey run vertically through dem to reinforce dem, dem be like sey dem no get enough metal wey dey run horizontally through di column, dem talk sey Leo Parker, one structural engineer for Los Angeles.

Caltrans today dey use one version of di design wey be sey Oga Parker dey talk, e get one version wey dem dey call spiraling steel.

But di one wey dem dey koll Nimitz Freeway, wey nor get anytin like dat, skata di wall kon tear di wall rish groun. Di pipol wey dey di down floor dey waka anyhow for almost 15 minutes from di down floor.

Officials of state agency no quick explain why di reinforcement no dey.

Caltrans join di highway for 1977 afta $55 million statewide project wey dem dey do with steel cable for di freeway to di columns, so dat di building no go fall for quake.

Kaltrans spokesman, Jim Drago for Sacramento, no gree identify di engineer wey do di reinforcement work.

Locality, and road crash go revolve around whether government take "reasonable care" to build and maintain di buildings, na wetin John Messina, wey be Takuma, wey be personal injury lawyer wey be highway engineer, and maintenance case.

You fit no know sey the person wey carry wetin dem take build am fit still dey yuzles.

Di result of di quake certainly raise question weda na sense wey dem take do am, Oga God Messina talk.

Given di seismic history of Bay Area, e be like sey I see six six earthquake wey dey plan to happen.

Caltrans Mr. Drago defend di agency work on top Nimitz Freeway say di work do well, well, e say Basically, we get severe earthquake of significant duration, and na just sometin wey di structure no fit endure.

Angelically, Kaltrans, dis year, e begin dey do two round of seismic exercise around di state, dis time, e dey wrap freeway column for Steel blanket to reinforce.

But only bridge wey dey inside single row, and Nimitz Freeway wey dey inside double row, na im Oga Drago come comot, na im e con talk sey di reason na sey di technology dey so, sey we no fit retrofit multi- three building o.
