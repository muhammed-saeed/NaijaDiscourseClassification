Wheder na di great case wey dey make bad-bad case, as Justice Holmes talk am, who go fit doubt sey when great confirmation go follow dis big case wey dem dey drag for dia head, dem go carry am go court?

Etan Bronner talk for di judgement, how di Bork Nomination Shook America (noror, 399 page, $2250) na spirited story of di insidena of dis thing wey we don hear, we don do am with journalistic verge, but na distorted legal philosophy.

While di book make up di subtitle, di title ma na dubious.

Dis na wetin shake America sey dem nor dey fight to judge well, but na to use naked pawa take judge pipol wey dem dey opress.

For di basic structure, and style wey di book dey do, na novelist e be with character wey dey portrayal, wey dey play on top wetin dey happen for inside Washington docudrama, e be like sey na one kind yeye tin we dey see for inside Washington docudrama na im we dey see pass for inside constitution.

Oga Bronner, e be like sey di thing wey dey im mind, na im e con dey look for.

I doubt dat one.

Given Democratic Front of Reagan victory, and court appointment, contemptory plan, and Mr. Bork paper trail of vulnerable write, e clear sey Judge Bork no get any chance to confirm.

As Oga Bronner take talk am, di oda meat smell for air.

E fit be sey because of sey de win, Oga Bork attacker dey pass im own defender pass im own defenders.

Ralph Neas, na im dey organize genius, dey whip a group of pressure groups into an irresistible attack force.

Hardvard'S Laurence Tribe na di legal battle, e lay out legal strategy for senators, and witnesses to follow.

But na Ted Kennedy score di most powerful ting wey dey inside im searing portrayal of "Robert Bork's America" o, di parade of imaginary ogbonge tings wey go follow am, from di position of Mr. Bork take over two years.

Sen. Kennedy, no mind di moral right wey e get for di moral high ground, e jump come out well, well.

I add two oder ones.

Publican Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, na im dey contest wey dem wan do to show sey Oga Bork don ready to stretch di Constitution for one area (free speech), but e no gree join di oda side.

E achieve one correct media play, and e enable Sen. Afterward, ammunition come from left legal diorist Ronald Dworkin wey for New York City bin paint picture of constitutional measef against di Constitution, especially on top of "original intent" for inside di Constitution, especially on top of "original intent" for inside di Constitution.

Di nomination wey still dey ground, if to say some of dem wey be Democratic moderate for South, and South, dem for still lose party.

But Democratic Sen. Bennett Johnson of Louisiana come remind di little group sey anti-Bork black, and women fit get di margin wey go punish dem for next Senate election.

Demographics join together withmainstream and demonisation to seal Robert Bork fate.

Upshot?

Oga Bork enemy choose to fight war, hold am, keep am.

Even with di smooth confirmation of Anthony Kennedy, one “80 percenter” only softer court judgement wey dey give dem pass Mr. Bork, oda Democrats fit win di fight, but dem lose di fight.

But anoder upshot now, na di chilling message wey di Bork hearing dey carry out into di legal culture wey Supreme Court dey carry talent.

Di word go go every law school wey be sey doz wey dey do federal court ambition must travel go for safe constitutional journey wit no paper, no jinger paper, no jinger for deir tongue, or pen.

Happily, di author simply no supply philosophical frame to sustain im report.

E don too swallow di matter for activist law school culture.

By stepping deeper into di doctrine of justice, e for don tay wey e don dey go back to justice Holmes.

E go discover am too for Alexander Bickel wey be one subtle legal scholar, Oga Bork's close friend for Yale wey dey influence di judge well, well afta Oga Bronner don yarn.

Still, di long view of Robert Bork as constitutional thinker must be spotless one.

E get power for im majoritarian doctrine wey dey keep di court clear sey different different group dey push each oda, and e dey make most of dem stand for democracy to give lawmakers and govnors chance to take rule.

Ehn unfortunately, Oga Bork fail to see di difference between dis pressure, and di emergence of major issues critical to society wey must be judged if na to cohere.

Sey different schools dey for Brown vs.

Knock of Education, na dat one be di ting.

Wit di coming of abortion again, na im come be di best left of a line of legal judgement for Supreme Court instead of di chaos of 50 state lawmakers.

Think am, and as you dey see am, you go see am, you go see am, you go see am, you go see am, you go see am for inside the Griswold case, to abortion, you go see am.

One fit understand Oga Bork sey di new way to take do privacy, na im go enter ologborangandan wey be sey Supreme Court wey be sey na men, and women wey be sey de bin get right, gut, and sey dem get where dem go fit do reach.

Wetin dey certain be sey if Americans allow anoda ting like di degrading borek confirmation circus, e go dey for deir peril.

Mr. Lerner na one person wey dey write history for New York.
