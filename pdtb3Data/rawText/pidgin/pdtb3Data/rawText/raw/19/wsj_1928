Sothebyec, di biggest auction house wey dey inside di world, na im dey enter big, big, big house on top di level wey dem dey sell art from John T. Dorrance Jr. Campbell Soup Co.

Financial Services division don guarantee di Dorrance family say dem go receive minimum of $100 million for di collection regardless of how di art take be, people wey dey close to di transaction talk.

Di collection wey include two early Picasso, van Gog, one Monet, oda paintings, furniture, and porcelain, na dem sell am last night for di first six auction.

Wetin sotheby dey do well, well like investment bank.

One corporation wey wan sell stock, or bond, na Wall Street firm na im dey buy securities outright, dey accept di financial risk of buying buyers.

If investment bank fit sell securities at higher rate pass di one wey di issuer dey pay, dat one dey gain.

For di first night wen dem sell am, for example, di sale wey dey inside di Impressionists masters bid na $116 million.

Dat one small pass Sotheby own wey be $111 million.

Normally, Sotheby go don get 20% on commission.

Instead, people wey dey know di transaction talk sey di auction house decide to go dat percentage to collect di collection, and in exchange for more dan $100 million.

Artefact sellers talk sey while market dey sometimes guarantee who dey sell one very fine work of art a minimal price, financial commitment of dis size dey unprecedented.

Diana D. Brooks, president of Sotheby's North America division, e don deny say e go give Dorrance dem money back guarantee, e call am aproko, buried in di glossy hardbound catalog for di sale, but e appear to be statement say Sotheby get interest for dis catalog.

Explain one Sotheby talk, di statement wey e go carry out na im dey yarn o.

We get some level of financial intrusion inside di collection, we no talk specific ting.

Frank Mirabello wey be lawyer for Dorrance estate, with the Philadelphia law firm, Lewis & Bockius, no gree comment on top di financial arrangement.

Sotay de don do hundred million guarantee for Dorrance collection, from archrival, auction house, Christie International PLC, Christie don do small, small business for Dorrance family over di years.

When Christie savants ask why di firm no go sell Dorrance collection, representatives of di Dorrance family, dem talk sey na money matter, sey Michael Findlay, Christie head of impression, and modern painting na im de talk am.

Plenty, plenty people wey dey do business for Wall Street don become part of the art business now and deir money don help make di art dey grow, but now, e be like sey sotheby dey return di compliment.

For November 1987, Sotheby basically present wall street type (bridge loan) of about $27 million to Australian businessman Alan Bond to take buy Vincent Van Gogh Irises for $53.9 million.

Dem do di highest work wey dem fit do for art.

But two weeks now, Sotheby don yarn sey di painting dey lock, and key dey for di loan, because de never pay am fully.

Sotheby dey offer such deals because sey na art sellers market, at least wen best work dey concern, according to Ralph Lerner wey be lawyer, and author of di book Art Law, sey e be like sey many art dey sell, but competition dey more.

Di competition dey give di seller di power to cut big deal.

Dorrance family go still receive huge chunk of di auction price above $100 million people wey be sey de don talk am.

But it's likely sey Sotheby go do a higher commission, wey dem dey call override, on top di amount wey dey beyond di guarantee.

So di by don dey aggressive dey promote di Dorrance sale.

For one tori, inside one of di auction last, na sotete by take dey look di money wey dem dey sell inside one million naira.

More recently now, Sotheby don predict di collection sey di money go be $140 million.

Dat one na di highest value for single collection for auction history.

Di decision to put di total collection for di block dey surprise many pipol since na Oga Dorrance bin be chairman for Philadelphia Museum of Art, and dem bin tink sey many of di work go be donated to di institution.

For di last night sale, 13 of 44 work wey dem sell na Aska International Gallery, di art acquisition unit, Aichi Financial, one Japanese conglomerate wey get 7,5% of Christie own.

Meanwhile, Sotheby guarantee dey raise eyebrow for art world, consumer talk sey di auction house na disinterested middle man o, according to New York art dealer, David Tunick.

While e add sey im no get wahala for auction house wey dey sell market wey be sey de gats get money, sey e no suppose dey inside small print.

For dat kind situation, e say, di house, e go put di best light on top tings, for example, auction house talk on top di condition of artist wey dey sell artwork, sey make dem look am well, well.

Bowman, wey be di president for Art Funding Corp, di art lender, na im dey go on, dey go on at every level.

Deal and auction house know if de no lay half a million for dis, anoder one go, na dat competition.

For January, two small gallery for New York, Coe Kerr Gallery and Beadleston Fine Arts, come arrange one big art gallery wey di Askin family get, wey near where di auction house dey, with money wey dem dey sell for upstair, about $25 million.

A Christie talk sey while while di auction house sometimes dey waive im seller commission to attract art work, e still dey collect commission from di buyer, Christie no go fit offer financial guarantee because Christine dey believe sey im primary role na auction house, and therefore, as agent agent for sale, no be bank.
