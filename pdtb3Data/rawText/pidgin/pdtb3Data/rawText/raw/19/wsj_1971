Steve Jobs stop to dey use technology dey push customers wey be Next In, to dey sell new machine.

Mr. Jobs move to rehearse two of im computer draw yesterday, by reducing di entry price for next machine by $1,500, or 23% if di person wey dey sell go use hard disk drive alternative to Naira Opposite.

Hard drive wey be sey na im be di storage device for almost every computer wey dey use am, na im go still dey available next next for market wey be sey person wey buy am go pay full.

Mr. Jobs, di co-founder of Apple Computer Inc, e don start four years now to dey hope to do revolution for di way computer dey take dey do, and dey use am.

Di next one wey e dey do, na for university computer users, na im dey do am, na im dey do am, na im dey do am, na im dey do am, na im dey do am, na im dey do am, na im dey do am, na im dey do am, na im dey do am, na im dey do am, na im dey do am for computer, dey do am for computer, and na im dey do am for computer.

But di computer still dey sell wetin e get for market, weda na software or di one wey dey di computer wey too slow.

Di machine start to dey carry come di end of last year.

Di firm wey dey closely hold company never still talk to customers.

But most universities wey don buy di machine say de dey buy small number for evaluation purposes.

Universality fit buy next computer without optical device for $4,995

Computer wey get di Osinbo go still cost $6,495, but from now on, every computer wey get hard drive, and supply, no go cost at all for di people wey don buy next machine.

Community customers fit buy di same system through Businessland Inc, one computer retailer wey dey for San Jose, CAB about $3,000 ah.

Oga Jobs talk sey di change na from customers wey dey frustrated for di performance of di optical device wey no be standard equipment from any rival.

Anoder factor be sey customers dey ask sey why you no give us cheapest system? Oga, na for one conference on top university computing here o.

For example, dem dey use one machine wey dem dey call operation wey dem dey call operation wey dem dey call operation wey dey control wetin dey happen for inside computer.

But di technology, di one wey dey reliable, e go slow pass di one wey dey use hard drive.

To make around di delay wey be sey di optical device, Businessland, wey be Next, exclusive dealer for corporations, e don tay wey be sey customers dey buy hard drive machine o.

Next one wey be sey dey rely on top of all di main drive wey dey every next computer, sey di one wey be sey dey operate for many years, sey di technology go play very important role for di next ten years, sey we dey very, very committed to optical storage technology, sey we dey tink sey we go rush go like dis for a few years. Sey di next generation of optical drive go be like strong drive, but e go depend on top all di machine wey dey.

But university computer specialist wey be sey de welcome di move, call am necessary retreat from cutting edge of technology, and one wey be sey de wan increase next sales for campus.

From di standpoint of technology, dis one na backward," na Jerry W.rufer, na senior computing manager for di state university system o, but e go boost next to sales.

University say next, de must even lower student price even before big, big student go buy di machine say we still like to see student model, de say Ronald Johnson, di director of academic computing for Minnesota, Gustavus Adolphus College wey don buy eight next machine.

Road ehn no be small wahala for wetin we dey use take share Naija computer sef.

Most of di software dey for small floppy disk, but di next one no dey come with di device wey dey read am.

Next computer sef need to get more software, but Oga God, den say e go need more soon.

E say e expect Lotus Development Corp to introduce di next one wey be 1-2-3 spreadsheet for 1990.

Education come add sey Next, dem go soon bring one colour for im computer.

Every major maker dey offer computer wey get black colour.

Nna when e go do di same ting, but e believe sey e get colour for development.
