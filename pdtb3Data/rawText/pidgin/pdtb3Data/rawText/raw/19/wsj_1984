:.START

I enter Mastergate, Larry Gelbart's new comedy for Criterion Centre wit plenty trepidation.

Nothing, I assumed, na someting wey I go just carry for mind come out like a postponement on top di iran contra affair.

But I don underestimate wetin Oga Gelbart do, and di persistence of scandal for Washington.

Di play wey dey play for Iranian Contra show sey dis one wey dey happen for di world don dey hot well-well for di past 30 years.

In fact, at one point, Merry Chase (Melinda Mullins), a cool, kain television announcer, recite a dozen, or more kain gist wey don dey sele on top di Department of Housing, Urban Development, di savings, and di loan industry.

At stage, one billboard dey progress, complete with crystal chandelier overhead, and one lifesize copy of di signing of di Constitution for background.

Di witness table na center stage, and under am na di parapheralia for di ever present media in case of TNN, di Total News Network.

No be only sey de dey dere, camera operator dey dere, but de show am for monitor throughout di theatre.

Di theatre metaphor no be by itself.

Mr. Gelbart clear sey all di people wey dey inside testimony, lawyer, interrogator, and news media, all of dem na performers.

As di tori of “Mastergate ” dey unfold, we learn sey di Internal Revenue Service seize one of di property of one foreign financier wey dey owe government many, many tax.

Di man, e be like sey e get one Lichtenstein corporation wey dem don licence for Libya, and wey dey hide for Bahamas.

He himself lives in a 'consecutorial series of unnumbered house in a town in Switzerland, di property wey di IRS seize, na Hollywood film studio, Master Pictures Incorporated (MP).

Suppose be sey di IRS go sell some tings wey be MPI, but before dem go sell am, dem go call one small IRS agent for di hospital room wey be Wylie Slaughter wey be di dying head of di Central Intelion Agency.

Di lowa agent, Abel Lamb wey you know sey de dey led to di slaughter, dem don order make e take over di studio.

E no too tey di studio studio dey produce one forty million picture wey dem dey call Tet, di Offensive, and Tet, di Book, and Tet, di Album. Di picture wey dey for Central American Republic of San Elvador, na one cover wey go carry up $800 million of arms to Los Otros wey be rebellious group wan take over from Ambigua wey be leftistististist.

Di man wey dey handle Slaughter now, na Major Manley Battle, Oga Gelbart stand for Col. Oliver North.

Director Michael Engler don do one kind big party wey dem dey do to dey carry out people wey dey popular political party, and to dey play di big character wey dey show for inside di congressional hearing.

Daniel wey come from Bargen, na one man wey im name na Daniel, wey come from Bargen, wey im name na Daniel, wey come from Bargen, na im come dey do one kind big fight wey dem dey call big boy boy, wey im name na Jeff Weiss na fire, bribe and tear gas as senator wey dey representate Major Battle. Zach Grenier dey vex dey play big time dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo, dey play wayo,

Wit one woman wey dey pregnant, with Major Battle, dey do American flag, and as di Vice Presido wife dey waka wit white hair, dey wear tailor suit, and pearl, dey do like sey na Barbara Bush waka go di last detail.

Ehn e clear sey Oga Gelbart sympathiser no dey lie o, but e be sey e dey even yarn o for inside dissatisfactory jab wey e dey take dey punish senators, and congress people especially for inside media.

Mr. Gelbart sef dey play di game, mastergate dey subtitle di talk, and Oga Gelbart dey play dat ball, and anybody.

E describe one mastergate flunky as one person wey experienced metheorial disappearance, come see imsef say blanket dey appeal for bureau of Indian Affairs.

But dis one wey I dey talk so, no be only punk and play e dey mean.

Mr. Gelbart dey tear di obfuscation, di sekonsishon, di base of language wey e dey si for difren side.

As di ear dey open, Sen. Bowman (Jerome Kilty) na im dey yarn o sey, “Make I give one tin wey be sey we no dey hide from skin, or goats toscapescape”, Major Battle himself talk for pure pen penis sey: “If further na money stroke wey dey give freedom, na im dey cut off for di knee with no paddle.

Di evening na only ninety minutes, wit no interference, but even as di play dey progress, Oga Gelbart eye no go sharp again as e dey progress more and more as e dey target.

But di evening wen e dey, na dat evening e dey take am well, well and na dat evening e dey take am well.

For Mastergate, Oga Gelbart don give us not just one, but two commodity wey don disappear from Broadway theatre o, sharp political satire, sharp appreciation for language.
