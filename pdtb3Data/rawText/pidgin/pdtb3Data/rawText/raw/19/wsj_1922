Di Lethal shudder wey dem sack San Francisco Bay Area a 6.9 on top Richter scale no match di great earthquake for 1906 a.

Di difference of just one35 point on di scale wey Charles Richter of Caltech for di 1930 era, na im be sey di old quake, na 10 to 20 stronger na im be di Director of University of California Berkeley Seismomole.

Di ground na 20 to 30 miles stretch from San Andreas Fault on Tuesday, Oga Johnson add.

For 1906, the place wey the two of dem dey go, long reach 300 miles (as dem dey go) and e wide rish two feet).

Di building wey dey back of Tuesday wall wey dey 10 miles (nor be Santa Cruz town) and 50 miles (nor bi San Francisco city) na one place wey dem dey call, “Havoc-hoppa” for di coast.

But dem still dey suffer for di building and road wey fall for where dem dey trowey dirty put (dem dey call am Marina District of San Francisco and Bay Bridge) wey dey two side.

Landfill, agriment, and unconsolidated earth, may be feeling like rock, but e dey turn liquid wen you shake am, na im Douglas Segar, professor of geoscience for San Francisco State University inside one televised interview.

Our earthquake behave well, well like Mexico City earthquake where great wahala wey dey happen far from Epicenter.

Oga Johnson wey be one of di Berkeley seismographic station, talk sey if e do well, well, e go fit do am.

You fit drive big pile on top am, build on top am” e tell di example of San Francisco financial district where many new glass tower bin dey survive almost all di demolition.

But di public policy wey earthquake affect, e go hard to address o, Mr. Johnson yarn.

Na short, short tori be dis o, e say we don know for years, and years we don get plenty old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old building.

One old house wey dem dey call Golden State Bank building, for front of street, di wall wey fall on top each other, fall on top one wall wey fall ontop each other as dem dey move go one side, di wall wey separate dem from di one wey dey up, fall ontop each other and di wall wey separate dem from di one wey dey up, fall on top each other as e dey move go di third floor. Dust bin dey fall for di road sotey e dey miss for road.

Upon di old building stock, Oga Johnson con say come down to money.

Na wahala.

We know sey e dey dere.

And sooner or later, we gats do someting about am.

Di koko wey dey for inside di quake wey happen dis week so, na im make major, big, big quake wey come follow for back no dey gree give big, big, big quake on top di quake wey dey follow for back.

Di big one still dey ground, Oga Johnson bin yarn for interview sey Bay Area get three very bad tings, di San Andreas, di Hayward, and di Calaveras fault.

E quake no be di solution wey we dey face now.

For inside California, na di reality be dis.
