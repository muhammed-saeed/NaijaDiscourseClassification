Just after midnight, federal spending start to drop by $16 billion.

Wetin you talk sey we dey close down for di poker game, go house, and bank di $16 billion?

Na basically wetin budget director, Richard Darman dey suggest, and we think sey e deserve di support wey e fit get.

If human being no fit cut federal spending well, and dem no fit, make computer do am.

Congress wit ehm White House complicity don dey manipulate spending account for many years under omnibus appropriation bill (in fact, before before, if to say na $16 billion e go con even big pass), we dey suspect sey voters don tire to dey buy.

For example, even yesterday sef dem dey allow people wey dey sell things to people wey dey sell things to demsef.

Under di law, Gramm-Rudman's across di board level for federal dey suppose to dey permanent.

Social security and spending for poor people, na exempt for dem.

But, Associated Press account of Monday sequester order wey President Bush sign, neatly capture di contempt congress show on top di matter of legally binding commitment, na im dey yarn o sey de bin don dey talk for some weeks sey de wan roll down di cuts as soon as de agree to a compromise on a deficit deficit bill.

Mr. Darman inclination to save di sequester was backed up yesterday by di White House Press Secretary, Marlin Fitzwater sey dere is some feeling here sey di cuts na di way to go.

E go reduce money to buy very fine fashion. Opposite for Washington don dey waver say dis one na di smallest talk wey no get power.

E dey look us like golden opportunity for George Bush to chop all dis talk about timid, our Presido.

Oga Bush go show ear for public say e go allow Washington elite dem wey dey manipulate dis budget, bureaucrats, lobbyists, congress staffers na dem dey live only one year for limited diet.

Ask Tommy Lasorda, thin dey inside.

Senator Phil Gramm-Rudman bin yarn on Monday sey in di 20 years wey im bin rule for 1985, federal goment don gada about 11% a year, since di law, e don grow at least 5% per year.

Anoder major factor wey dey bring up di positive trend na Ronald Reagan decision early inside im presido to fight budget war on top di expenditure side instead of to dey collect tax.

George Bush continue to support di tax dam na im dey sustain dis strategy of pressuring Congress to choose between competing priorities instead of just saying yes to all di special interest constituencies wey dey fill di PAC.

If Washington elite go burst di tax dam, Americans go enter inside red sea for new spending like federalized child care.

Chidrene na one of di many extraneous bill wey bin comot for Senate reconciliation bill last Friday.

Odas na di capital gains cut, section 89, wey be sey disability workers bill, and unprecedented reconsideration of di wahala health act.

All dis one still dey di House's 1,878 page reconciliation bill, and many of dem say de no dey push out cherished bills, just to see dem die.

Publications dey especially wan guarantee from di House leadership sey dem go do up, or down vote on top di bill.

House Speaker Foley suppose deliver dat promise.

Dis na di way government suppose take dey work wit politicians to carry out vote wey deir constituent fit identify, instead of to hide am for di big reconciliation truck.

Wi remember as e be for Washington wey be sey na big time wey be sey, men and women dey spend well, well, dey plan, dey plan, dey plan, dey plan, dey plan, dey plan, dey plan, dey plan, dey plan, dey plan, dey plan, dey plan, dey plan, dey plan, dey plan, dey plan, dey plan, dey plan, dey plan, dey plan, dey go, soldiers dey pay, dey go, dey find how poor, dey go.

Dose days don go.

No reason wey we get to believe sey Metropolitan Washington don fat, come rich, come lazy for inside federal colossus e go change big, big ting for im own initiative.

Save the person wey dey ask for money and make Washington shout.
