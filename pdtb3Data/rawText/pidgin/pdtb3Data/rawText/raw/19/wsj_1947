(For centennial year, Wall Street Journal go report tins of di past century wey be sey na milestone for American business history.)

YOM KIPPUR WAR, WHEN EGYPT CRASHon enter Israel for Oct. 6, 1973, di day wey bad pass for Jew people calendar, last only one month.

But one far-far effect still dey with us.

Arab State dem, dey always vex for U.S. government people as dem dey support Israel people, dey see sey dem carry one bomb wey no get power wey fit kill human being.

For October dis year, six Arab countries for di Persian Gulf jacked up price well, well.

For Oct. 22, Saudi Arabia wey be world largest exporter na im dey carry di oil comot go U.S. and Netherlands, but dem no dey support European Union at all.

Di timing dey perfect.

Arab people don try to embarrass dem before.

For 1956 when Britain, France and Israel enter Egypt to seize Suez Canal, Arab producer come cut light for Europe.

Teza wey dey pump hard, hard o.

But for 1970, 1970, and 1973, dem stop to dey produce oil.

Import, den six million barrels per day, na mostly Venezuela, and Canada.

But Middle East supply come dey increase.

By 1973, U.S. dey bring two million pound of Arab oil, plus 10% of di 17.3 million barrel wey dey use everyday.

Politics, and economics plan together.

Japan and Europe dey depend on mideast oil pass U.S., so e no go do business for Arab people or dey sell deir precious oil.

Di U.S. dey supply oil come from relabelabel supply, dem dey carry oil come, no one fit tell am where im come from.

But di bad, bad, bad, bad, di U.S. and di oda governments dem wey get oil, short, and crisis, con dey fly o, but no be as e take be.

Di spot wey dem disgrace, na mostly di confusion for Washington, even though sey kold dey block for people wey dey drive for gas pump.

Di embargo last only six months, but di money wey dem dey pay come turn to life.

Wetin Arabia start, inflation finish.

All of dem na: five a-burning crude oil, 35 gallons of gas.
