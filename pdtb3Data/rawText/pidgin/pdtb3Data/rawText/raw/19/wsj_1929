Egon Krenz, di man wey dem wan become East Germany new leader, na im dey face di same task wey don fall give neighbouring socialists, dey reform one country for crisis.

But unlike di oda leaders wey dey for east Bloc, Oga Krenz, na on top im own country matter, na im Germany go take join hand.

Mr. Krenz wey dey 52 years, dem dey koll am old ironfist. E fit bi sey e continue to dey run one country wey dem dey call Berlin Wall.

Even if e shange to anoder Milton Friedman, e go still fit lose di country.

Mr. Krenz almost go be the younger one of Erich Honecker wey be im steadfast predecessor as ruler.

Mr. Krenz don follow for di same career wen obodo Oga, Honecker, two years now wey e don dey oversee di releasee Deutsche Jung, di youth group wey be di communist regime principal tool to stamp young people into socialist citizens.

More recently now, Mr. Krenz bin dey in charge of East Germany security, and na im be di youngest member of di ruling Politburo.

Face anoder Mr. Honecker, sotay many people for East Germany go run comot say di two Germany people go be one again for West Germany.

But if East Germany arthritic, Politburo, dey loose to allow Oga, Krenz do serious work for reform, e go face wahala just as fundamental tins go be.

To dey do amebo or to dey do amebo or to dey do amebo or to dey do amebo or to dey do amebo or oyibo.

Sey dis one wey dey happen so, dey hard now to imagine sey small, small like dis Federal Republic, de no go drag am enter some kind tie o, economic, Federal, and stronger wit West Germany.

Oga Krenz fit need small time to join e empire make e be like say e go do plenty work to promote Reunification Scenario.

Cartooners for West Germany don already mock di exodus one advert wey Mr. Honecker talk sey, â€œWanted: One people, West German embassies for Prague, Budapest and Warsaw dey continue to dey find refugee for dia gate.

East Germany, as e dey always do, fit make di country tight.

Two of the last thing wey the Honecker regime do, na to close di border for Czechoslovakia and put halogen light for some side for di frontier.

But with world wide opinion (likely for Moscow against East Germany), di country go turn ensef to Albania to stop refugee.

E get some kind report wey be sey Oga Krenz dey move to soften e name notably sey na im keep East Germany state police back for di country on top di 40th anniversary wey dem do for dis month.

But even if e affect Hydeto-Jekyll transformation, e go face serious political crisis, and Reunification Scenario Two.

Di problem be sey East Germany dey share with oda states like North Korea, but na only one side e go dey for East Blok.

When Poland move to reform, e go fit at least clean up di old one wey dey before, but dis one wey be sey Joseph Pilsudski do inter-activity, na political tin wey no be social tin.

Czech reformers fit recall Wilson as per di same period for deir country.

Even Soviet Union don porshu Peter di Great to rediscover, make e choose to.

But East Germany, na just di land of true socialism, apart from dat one, e get to contest wit West Germany to claim to di German identity.

Up till now, di main weapon of di work, and peasant state, na di ideology of socialism.

Wit di second economic miracle wey happen for West Germany, East Germany no go fit kontinue wit being di economic star for loss league again.

Without Moscow military and party behind, East Germany dey risk of integration.

If e go capitalism, e go increase trade with West Germany, e go convert imsef to di economic annexes of Federal Republic.

E get one kind bad logic for here wey be sey di land wey cause Karl Marx make am show sey socialism dey fail for one experiment wey dey use im own people dey control.

De may be force wey go delay dis scenario.

Di last person wey go surrender na Ideologue and Germany na people wey dey put hand for politics.

Di protesters wey greet Mikhail Gorbachev for East Berlin earlier dis month no dey shout sey go U.S.A o, de dey shout sey goby, help us.

Deologue for di oder side of di border fit also slow di process.

Heinrich Kohl governing body no dey support any side for politics at all as dem dey do for West Germany constitution afta dem make more than 500,000 people wey be German descent automatic citizens dis year alone.

But inside government, and inside think tank o, many West Germany dey maintain sey de no wan reunification o.

Definitely, dis one wey dey happen now, na wisdom especially for one nervous neighbour France.

But if to sey Germany pipol reuna, e go bi like sey na Germany bi dia kommunity, na pawa dem take do tins wey pass Bonn and Berlin own.

For one statement wey dey near di East German go do, wey dey near di glasnost, Otto Reinhold, di East German party diorist, e con even yarn sey di main ting, na for one East German radio interview wey dem dey do for Munich, sey di GDR dey different from oda East European states, sey which kind right dey different from oda East European states?
