Una surprise sey as una dey do business for U.S., dem dey cause fear sey di way di country dey export dey weak, and e dey bring wahala for financial market.

Di total wey dey sell goods from August to $10.77 billion naira, Commerce Department report sharperly from July to July $8.24 billion plus di largest deficit for dis year.

For di sekond month, truck fall for one row, go reach one record.

Dis one na one of di worst trade wey don happen since di dollar reach us out for 1987, na im Geoffrey Dennis, wey be international economist for James Capel Inc, as most analysts, Mr. Dennis no dey too read wetin dey inside one month number, but e say e dey likely say di balance for U.S. economy fit no good as e dey led to believe.

Di number na wahala for Wall Street, e say more important economic problem fit dey on top stock market matter last Friday.

Dow Jones Industrial Average tumble more dan 60 point after di report don release, before dem recover close 1865 point lower for 2638.73.

Sey dis bad business number wey be sey de dey do, e dey cause some kind deep gbege wey dey go down, sey na Norman Robertson wey be di chief economist for Mellon bank, e talk sey e dey raise questions on top deep sleep matter, on top budget deficit, on top trade deficit, and e be like sey e no get power to grip dey grip wit dem.

Trade report fall on top another one wey no settle since October 1987.

On October 14 of dat year, di announcement of one unusual trade wey dem dey do for August bin bring down price well, well.

Di slide continue until di record wey dey 508 point market drop for Oct. 19

But for 1987, na di latest one wey don happen on top business matter, but di current one, na afta some time wey don change.

Di bleak trade report, di Bush administration just play am.

Complainer Robert Mosbacher call di worse worse trading after two good months, and White House spokesperson, Marlin Fitzwater talk sey di deficit na "an unwelcome increase", e add sey we dey hope sey na just one month matter, and e go just dey turn around.

But di figures come add join di view wey many private analysts dey see sey di improvement for U.S. commercial deficit don dey run out of steam.

Di figures today go further evidence to support sey di improvement of di U.S. trade deficit don essentially stand at a level of about $110 billion annual rate," Jeffrey Scott wey be research fellow for Institute for International Economics, talk sey, "Na only last year we don get all di mileage wey we fit get from di dollar dereciation, and marginalisation of Federal Budget.

Di report wey dey comot for di second consecutive month for August, fall down 0.2% to thirty-41 billion.

Import, na six4% gain gain for di record wey be four hundred, eight billion.

No be only August own worse pass July own o, but di government bin revise July figure from di $7.58 billion wey dem bin report last month.

Plenty economists dey argue sey deep cut wey dey U.S. budget dey necessary before further trade go continue.

Dat is because di budget deficit na huge appetite for di country, for foreign goods, and foreign capital, over di nation capacity to export, people dey sick, dem don tire to dey hear dis deficit, but di imbalance still dey, dem still dey a problem.

Also, di increase in price of foreign currency over di past few months don increase di price of U.S. come out for overseas market, and e dey make di country competitive.

Since March, na almost flat load we dey export.

At dat time, William T. Archey wey be international vice president for di U.S. Chamber of Commerce, na im dey yarn o sey, â€œE clear sey di stronger dollar don carry import wey be sey de don dey reduce deir price.

Most economists dey expect slow U.S. economy to reduce importation.

But dem see small progress in exporting except di dollar, and federal budget.

Di best result wey we fit get from dis number na to see administration, and congress pikin wey dey carry di U.S. competitive economic footing, na im Howard Lewis, wey be di vice president for international economic affairs for National Association of Manufacturers, na im dey yarn o sey na to cut federal budget deficit.

August be sey de don reduce as dem dey sell wetin dem take dey do, wetin dem take dey do, capital, capital, food, oda tings, motor, parts, engine oda tings.

Di new way wey dem take dey do business na to dey increase am from one end to di oda.

Di number dey do as e dey do for di rite time.
