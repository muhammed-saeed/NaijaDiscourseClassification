Economy expert, David N. Laband's Sept. 27 editorial page, in Hugo Path, a Man-Made Disaster, dey shaut di total price wey dey go on top di level wey South Carolina Governor sama after Hurricane Hugo.

According by Oga Laband, "screaming na when income redistribution go hit home, to be sure sey di threat don hit home here.

But for Oga, Laband's rehash of free market logic, greed, and selfishness, na only wetin fit make person mind come down.

This one go make the chain wey dem dey sell for market short well well.

But no be sey resource dey go deir best, dey leave scarce goods for people wey dey sell am, but line go reduce because at higher price, many victims no fit get food, and medicine.

E no dey human being mind to talk sey poor woman wey no get work no go fit get im own house at di same price because e no get as e be for family wey get money well well.

Also essential relief supplies such as ice block block throughout di population because of potential health problem, contaminated food, and possible outbreak of disease.

Such spillover give di state di right to intervene for market, come gradually allocate resources.

Happily, no amount of money wey people dey contribute dey help dem, but na wayo dey help dem.

Why e good make dem find business men wey go rush enter, so dat dem go get plenty money?

Dis na di time wey dem go cancel di calawags wey go dey take over di situation if dem ever hope to face people for South Carolina again.

Government dey protect ice-blok, and oder profit people wey no fit see big gain.

South Carolina na one of the place wey we fit do o, because e dey quick and quick relief work.

Mr. Laband also get one rote talk wey e dey carry on top economy matter.

Give am money because e no know wetin economic equity be.

Oga Laband give us idea why economist talk sey e dey always wrong.

Dem dey set up yeye situation, no dey real, dey try to dey reason dem.

I dey surprised o sey e no advocate for people to dey loot, because dat behaviour can be for disaster, and every person get incentive to change income in im favour, and price was so much embraced by Charleston because the price of this situation is equivalent to looting.

Oga Laband, one of di more insidious threat wey we dey face when we dey deal with disaster like Hugo, anti profit ordinances wey be sey na Charleston City Council e dey drag to try do some kind thing.

As e focus on top di economic fowl, e no talk about some oda tings wey dey affect dem.

Dem dey use wetin dem get take protect life and property.

And dem dey reduce am, and e dey help hoarding.

And dem, or even di chance wey dem get, dey make di wahala wey dey happen among una, strong well-well.

Oga, Laban also suggest sey di Red Cross, Salvation Army, military unit, police, fire department, rescue unit, and individual citizens go stop deir efforts to help Hugo victims because de stop to dey promote di free market.

What of di caring people for di whole country wey dey contribute food, water, and other necessities of life to dis people wey fit be any of us?

De should also stop Messia free market?

Maybe e tink sey de should sell to di highest bidder.

And what of insurance firm?

Dem go need to pay exorbitant money to take collect im klot and materials?

Oga Laband suppose dey watch since im dey live for South Carolina.

For free market, dem fit raise im insurance company price to recover insurance company loss.

Na different tin I dey face now afta heavy breeze and heavy breeze don fall for my body.

My eye dey see big, big village, but na only small tin e dey see.

Dem really quick come back, and dem dey help each other well well.

Di shock of house wey dem scatter and di city work wey dem dey do, fit cause some people to confuse buying tins like house wey freezer full, or freezer wey meat full.

For Texas after Hurricane Alicia, major shariot wey dey carry dem go do essential goods for Houston, no dey overload, just good will.

Oga. Laband analysis of time, and compare wetin e dey do on top research, and development, na im confuse us for di affected areas.

For im theoretical approach, and im publication for dis venerable paper, na one big thing for am.

Too bad theory in practice.

People wey dey sell things, dem dey remember us well, well.

Di businesses wey dey under Oga Laban's effective price system, dem go remember am when normalcy return.

E fit be sey as time dey go, we no go fit patronise deir establishment for post humourera.

I get one question for Oga Laban: How I take explain to di single mother wey dey three step near me for three hours now wey be sey di two bags of ice, wey be sey de dey keep her pikin food, go reach her last $20?

I sure sey e go appreciate how e take manage im problem wey be sey dey price market now.
