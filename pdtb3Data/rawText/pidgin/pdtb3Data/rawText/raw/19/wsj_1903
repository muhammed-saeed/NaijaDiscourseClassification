Dale Lang wey do di acquiring of Ms and Sassy dis week na kukuma of di challenge wey im dey face.

Mr. Lang admit sey Ms. dey inside dire strait, and Sassy need big money to keep am alive.

But di 57 years old publisher don move kwik, kwik kwik dey handle magazine problem.

Last Friday, e tell staff of MSMEs sey di magazine for January go begin dey publish without advert.

Mr. Lang go comot wit expensive circulation drive, e no go talk to sales staff, and e go try to do di 17 years old magazine wey only dey supply supply.

Any foolish person fit do magazine wey cost well, well.

I wan publish one wey succeed, Oga Lang say for ms. It's time to publish for reader, not di advertiser.

As for Sassy wey dey contest directly with News Corp, di number seventeen magazine, Mr. Lang talk sey in di next two years, im go spend $6 million wey be sey dey promote and improve di magazine.

Though Sassy don grow well, well since when e start for March 1988, e don dey target people wey no dey do too much work, and people wey no dey do too much work, na dem dey handle am. Di people wey dey do dia work well, well, na dem dey handle am no be small problem.

Oga Lang talk sey di former owner of Sassy, na one person wey no dey hear word before, wey be sey di moral majik na to just do nothing, come drive am comot. E say Sassy no go gree o, but e add sey we go continue to dey monitor di editorial wey dey inside di magazine.

Assyria don recover, e don reach 500,000 mark, and advert page don dey stabilize for dis year for more than 300.

Wetin remain, Oga Lang say e get wetin all publishers wish, a bona fide niche, e get seventeen wey dey write more for mama, no be deir daughter, na im Oga Lang say but Sassy get anoda spirit.

E dey carry more mail a month pass wetin McCartney do for one year and no be mama dey do am.

I dey feel for Sassy as I do my work for 10 years now. Oga Lang come take Ms, and Sassy comot for di acquisition of Matilda Publications in di new one wey e just form for Lang Communications.

Di nashon get 70 of Matilda, but Citicorp get di rest through di Citicorp Venture Capital Partners.

E don reach two weeks now, Citicorp and Mr. Lang don pump $800,000 inside di matilda just to open door.

Industry observers don hala for Mr. Lang on top wetin some dey call on top im head, but im track for magazine wey dey inside general don get mixed review.

In addition to Ms. And Sassy, closely owned Lang Communications, na im include Success, one magazine for entrepreneurs, and small businesses, and Working Woman and Working Mother, two magazine wey dey magazine every month.

Working Woman, with circulation of one million, and working mother, with 625,000 circulation, na evritin wey dey produce magazine, na im dey make am popular.

But di magazine Success, na for some years, di tin tire person, di tin tire am.

E never too tey wey we change am to better one wey be sey na im dey di new one wey be sey dey di new one wey be sey dey di new one wey be sey dey di new one wey be sey dey di new one.

Dem go get at least profit on top di new one wey rival Venture dey do, anoder one wey be sey dey grow company.

Working woman and working mother don join do di work of working woman (mccl.) join body togeder with one small joint venture wey dem dey call Oga God Lang and Time Warner Inc.

Di joint venture dey open, wit McCartney magazine wey dem dey sell last summer go New York Times Co, about $80 million, and Time Warner don dey agree to sell di full money wey dem dey spend on top work, women, and working mother to Mr. Lang.

Executor for Time Inc. Magazine Co, one subsidiary of Time Warner don yarn sey di joint venture wey dem do with Mr. Lang no do well.

Di venture wey dem form for 1986, suppose be Time Low cost, safe entry into women magazine.

Oga Lang na very soon after e join forces when e talk sey e go negotiate rate individually with advertisers, a common practice for broadcasting, but for taboo wey be magazine publisher taboo.

In addition, McCartney put less than stellar performance.

Till when we come back, na so so wahala e dey kause for ad page and for circulation.

Time ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn ehn e

Oga Lang dey feel sey time don change, management change after dem form sey, and I no tink sey dem dey comfortable to enter competition for women service magazine.

Today, Oga, Lang believe sey im magazine go dey offer wetin many women magazine no dey, we dey write am for women level, e say we no get passive reader. Oga Lang talk sey even though sey some part of di company image na female, na female.

Mr. Lang don name am Carol Taber wey be di group publisher for New York based Lang Communications.

She go oversee working woman, working mama and Success Magazine and keep her post as the publisher of working women.

Di sale of McCartney, na times two wey Oga Lang pay for am, finance finance, time Warner's buy of Time Warner's 50% interest in working woman, and working mother.

Oga Lang talk sey im no dey scout new acquisition, at least for now, we go go outside go collect money, I no ready to do dat one o.

Plenty work dey to do on top wetin we get.
