Stock market dizzy gyration wey don dey since some days now don make many individual investors wish sey dem fit buy some kind insurance.

After all, dem no go forget di stock price wey come out after di October 1987 crash.

But while de wan dey on top similar buying opportunity now, de fear sey anoder terrifying stroke go jam dem.

Di solution, at least for some investors, e fit be sey players for stock market well, well.

Call am married put, di method na to buy stock, and simultaneously buy put on top dat stock.

E be like sey na fire insurance na im Harrison Roth wey be senior strategist for Cowen & Co talk.

Because option na to give di owner di right, but no be to sell di stock say na di price wey de say give di owner, or before di expiry date, di investor dey protected against sudden drop of di stock price.

But most investment advisers no dey recommend make person marry at all.

Dat is because di price of buying enter investor level when stock price increase.

Dis na di kind fire insurance wey you dey buy only when nearby forest dey on fire, Oga Roth talk sey you dey always want your house, but you no dey too suffer for your investment to get insurance.

No be only sey de go dey buy new one, but sey de go fit use am take protect di stocks wey one investor don already get.

Anyhow e be, di investor dey get three possible outcome:

: - if di stock exchange between now and now expire date, di put go probably expire like dat.

Investors go do am out of di put wey dem dey call premium, and dis one go reduce di stock market profit.

: - if di stock still dey for di same price between now, and di expiry date, di investor go reduce di price of di put, reduce di money wey di investor take dey buy from di closing sale of di market.

Sey worst scenario go happen if di number dey expire.

If di pump price for di stock fall, di pump go add more.

Once di stock price less dan di exercise, or di trike price, of di put, di gain go match di stock price of dollar.

Di goment set minimum of wetin di stock go dey sell during di lifetime.

When one stock fall for di put on strike, di investor just sell di stock for loss, e con sell di put on top profit.

Or di investor fit take di money, tender di stock to im, or im broker for anoder investor wey don sell am ontop di same stock.

Knorr dey handle all dese business through option Clearing Corp wey guarantee all dese traders.

Di accompanying table show how dis strategy go work for three stocks.

Even dough no dey di table, make person wey be investor know sey di money wey dem dey sell for di option, na part of any dividend wey di stock dey pay.

For example, Tenneco Inc dey pay quarterly dividend of 76 cents which go be before February option expire, na im go reduce cost of using di technique.

Dis one wey be sey, di investor risk no go pass three three6% on top total investment.

To simplify di calculation, commission on di option, and overstocking, no dey di table.

Doz wey dey buy and sell pass 650, plus some of di brodas and sistas.

But some investors may prefer a simpler strategy then hedging their individual holdings.

Dem fit do dis one by buying index put, wey be sey de just put price for index wey be sey na big basket of stock.

For example, di most popular index option na S/P 100 option, wey dey commonly call OEX.

E base on top di stocks wey dey make up Standard & Poor's 100 stock.

Unlike option on one issue, index option na only money, no be stock.

But while index option dey optional, de get some disadvantage.

For one thing, person wey be investor portfolio fit no close to S&P 100.

Because of dat one, di OEX insurance may or may not fully protect an investor holding in di event of market drop.

Dem add dis one join di oda one wey be sey na Friday afternoon dem suspend evritin wey dem dey sell for market, afta dem don sell S/500 future contract finish.

So one investor wey wan con gain gain for OEX, after di trading suspension go come out of luck.

Di oder side, na few individual issue de bin suspend for trading on Friday.

Normally, once di underlying investment don dey suspended from trading, di option on dat investment sef, e no dey trade.

To extend, wheder insurance wey you dey buy now, e dey worthwhile, di price of di option.

Dat price dey rise for di times of high market volatility.

But e go dey cheaper dan to take major hit.

Di protection from marrying, e dey eazy for person wey get anoda option wey some investors dey consider for di time wey trouble dey, selling call option on top of stocks wey di investor get.

Call option is similar to one put except sey di owner get right to buy shares at di stated price till expiration.

Call up option give investor small buffer say stock market no dey.

Dat one na because dem reduce di price of di stock akordin to di quantity wey dem dey sell di call.

But if di price of di stock increase above di strike price, di stock don dey on top di level wey dem go call am.

And dat one own, di investor dey miss on top any major upside down gain.

Dis calculation dey exclude di effect of commission wey di commission, and dividend wey di stock don collect.

All price na Monday close.
