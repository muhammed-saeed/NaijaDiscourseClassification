The New Crowd by Judith Ramsey Ehrlich, Barry J. Rehfeld (little, small, brown, 444 page, $19.95) Describe di dislacing of di old "our crowd" wey dey for di Jew wall street banking, as Saul Steinberg, Carl Icahn, Sanford Russell Russell and Brostenstein.

Plenty, plenty story dey inside: Gutfreund-Postel holiday, dey do im brother brother brother brother up and down.

Na two new people dey stay for one house wey dem build for one building wey dem dey call Postel penthouse on top of Gutfreund duplex.

Di penthouse elevator start from di Gutfreund landing, and Susan Gutfreund first stop light, so dat e go be like sey no higher floor dey dere.

To di extend, Oga, Postel break im toe for darkness.

Afta sometaim, di gutfreund decide to build one Christmas tree wey heavy rish twenty ton and e go dey sopraiz pipol wey dey come holiday.

Naw, make una use crane take karry am for postels terrace.

Postels no gree give me permission.

But di Gutfreund workers go ahead, na only to dey catch for flagrante na im Joan Postel wey call police.

Before di Gutreunds waka comot for di main road, one big house wey dem dey call Fifth Avenue, and one 18th century mansion na one million garage wey dem excay for Paris, di Post office don collect one million koins (money wey dem dey pay) make dem no for fit dey honbol again, and na one neighbourly spirit hit di building with thirty million lawsuit.

Nothing less, e be like sey, e fit console dem for deir trauma.

Where di money from come?

E get one young man wey im name na John Gutfreund. When e still be beard man, e come dey do business, come be oga for business, come be oga for jibiti, come be oga for jibiti, come be oga for jibiti.

As e dey grow for di firm one, e kon get pawa well-well, even though sey en new wife, Susan, dey shine for di kourtyard. E dey wear fawol and na fawol e dey wear.

After e don be head of di company for 3 months, e and im partner sell am give Fibro, one big commodity trading outfit, $550 million inside di company stock.

(Limidol wey en family don dey serve for 70 years for di firm door-mot, even doh e tink sey e go dey there forever), e nor tok anytin.

Mr. Gutfreund don collect $32 million, whereas Billy Salomon collect $10 million, much less dan sey e don conduct di sale, I feel amtrayed.

But di time wen e suppose to die don rish.

Di money wey e get like wetin Phibro do for di next two years, if to say e get am, e for get big bundle.

Di book still talk about di different - different operation wey different police dey do for Lehman Bros and other grand-grand papa dem.

Many people wey be oga patapata, wey be oga patapata, wey be oga patapata, wey be oga patapata, na im dey waka sotay when e vex, im face red sotay na tiny slit na im dem talk about Lehman's Lewis Glucksman.

The people wey dey bank that time — Belmont, Warburg, Lehmans, Baches and Schiffs — don stress on top all probo, probo, tradition, continuity and reputation.

Dem be old fashion, gentlemen wey happen to be German Jew extraction.

But as e bi today for di world wey dey wall, pipol wey dey do wiked tins, dey weak evriday.

Kukuruku dey prefer where birds dey stay and e dey leave dia eggs.

But di old guide, e hire di New Crowd people, e carry di cuckoo.

So as di Old Crowd take come from branch, e no too surprise.

But di old guards still get right to disqualify di new way wey dem take dey make money, such as greenmail, (for one tori wey dey inside di Corporate Boardroom, wey dem dey call, “Fear and Loathing for Corporate Boardroom”, di oda one wey be sey na company dey do di ting wey be sey na big company dem dey do am, even though sey na big company dem dey support.

House takeover na very, very new phenomenon.

Sometimes dem dey do better, but sometimes dem no dey do better.

First, make management focus on short term result, de stop building for future just di opposite of Japan.

Second, who be better shareholder for long time, no worry too much when di stock price drop small, small, e go bounce go back.

But if person wey dey buy something take over wen di stock don dey weak, di owner no go fit get im recovery.

Di raiders meanwhile, de don evolve deir own pattern of spending deir new millions.

As de describe am for di New Crowd, de dey carry on top big, big wifes, dey go Greenwich, Conn, or Bedford, N.Y. buy OK picture, and dey share di wealth wit decorators.

Because de don donate well, well go museum, de want make place dey for board.

Di book dey patronise for dis new richness wey get weakness, wey get weakness.

But on balance, charity game help America.

If museum, and charity no gree do am, na so City Hall go do am o.

Dem don observe am say di main ting wey dey do bad for tainted money na, tain don do am.

Some of di New Crowd operators don cross di line from di sex matter to di criminal and dem dey sell big-big fine tins like: Ivan Boesky, Dennis Levine, Martin Schegel, Victor and Steven Posner, and now Michael Milken and maybe Leona Helmsley.

Di glitzy office wey Ivan Boesky bin open for one prison cell before, na im get one commodity operator wey im name na Marc Rich and Pinky, today fugitives from a potential century agbadun.

All dis tins dey make di Old Crowd sopraiz well-well.

But di phenomenon no be Jew phenomenon.

E don dey always happen sey people wey dey outside di club wan climb inside, and some go cut corner inside di club.

Some of di big-big house wey dem build for di fift Avenue and Newport palazzi, dem still build dia dota wedding give strenjas.

Mr. Boesky na king like Jay Gould, Jim Fiske, and Commodore Vanderbilt.

So who know?

E fit be sey na one generation or two people for New Crowd go fit dey respect us well well, like sheep wey rape us well well.

Or maybe Wall Street, when e don suffer reach, go see sey finance na service industry, and change its ethos.

Mr. Train na president of Train, Smith Investment Counsel, New York.
