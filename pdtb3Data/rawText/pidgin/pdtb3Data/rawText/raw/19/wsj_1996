For August, shortly after Wang Laboratories Inc talk about $424.3 million loss, and replace im Presido, two Boston sales people send letter give customers say: "We dey expect sey una go soon dey read news for press wey dey report di Amazing Comeback for Wang."

How soon na im Wang go stage come back, or if na at all, na still matter for di matter.

But Wang sales people dey try to cope wit biggest wahala wey any marketer fit face, dem dey sell part of one company wey dey on top rope.

If your prospector dey risk di whole time, and you no feel am sey stable company don lose you before you start, na so Mary Ann Cluggish wey be Wellesley, Mass, sales consultant wey be high tech company.

E fit happen for any industry.

Make we see di wahala wey Audi sales people dey face as dem trow lie lie on top di car door, or na exxon traders wahala for di wake of di oil wey dey leak.

Like thousands of sales people before dem, Wang dey find how e go take fight di bad news, e dey very important make we dey carry body down, even dough we know sey hard work dey front, na Richard Miller wey be di Lowell, Mass, computer concern, new Presido, for one video message to sales people after he take over.

Wanda enter financial trouble because of excessive overhead, and because of optimistic sales forecast.

Di mainline computer, and di one wey dem dey call microcomputer, don lost for computer wey dey cheap.

Last year, na heavy money wey dem dey borrow borrow am, na im suffer am well, well when sales come down instead of rise.

After di company yarn yarn for fiscal third quarter, na im Wang's marketing department give di sales force answers to questions wey be sey how you no know sey you wan lose $55 million, and Is Wang still a viable company?

Sales people dey try push deir product, and avoid talking about finances.

Knorning such question na defensive, Kenneth Olissa, Vice Presido, marketing, sey na antithetical to di selling art na im e dey talk o sey even though sey financial result, sey e be like sey na wahala for person wey no too know balance sheet.

For one sales strategy meeting, one executive suggest make sales people become expert on top di annual report.

Oga Miller con talk sey even me sef, I no sabi even di footnote sef.

Instead, e dey talk sey if sales people fit get customer wey go talk about Wang own, e, or top of financial officer go try add money wey be sey deir own don finish.

Like Metschan, one salesman for Wang's Austin, Texas, office, we get broezier method, we dey tell dem three billion company sey dem no dey chop.

We dey tell dem sey all di major company, dem dey get financial problem, many, many computer company dey get slump, and earnings dey decrease, but most of dem don lose like X Xtra, or dey carry like dat big money.

Oga Miller talk sey after sharp sales fall for July, and August, sales come stabilize for September.

Although Wang go report loss for first quarter, Sept. 30 and full fiscal year, Mr. Miller say im expect sey di company go return to profit by four quarter.

Experts on sales technique say anybody wey be sey dey represent one troubled company, meh e dey waka well, well, sey if e sell man name for dis time of trouble, sey na wahala, na wahala for di long run wey be sey dey go. George Palmatier, wey be Minden, and sales consultant for di marketing edge, na im dey yarn o.

John Sullivan wey be management recruiter with Daniel Roberts Inc. of Boston wey don do senior sales position for Polaroid and Atari say di customer go dey react to power.

Knorre di present condition.

Show am business as usual.

Dat one no easy o.

Wang customer na Data Management Manager wey wan make sure sey deir customers dey stable, well maintained companies wey go dey around to fix bug, and upgrade computer for years to come.

For buyers, dis na career risking decision", Jean Conlin wey dey supervise one network of Wang computers for di admission department for Boston University.

University dey reason sey dem dey put $250,000 to store application, sey before di real bad news, we dey look Wang well, well.

But dis one wey be sey de dey now financial condition, me I go don get strong head wey be sey na di vice president dey in charge of buying.

Ms. Conlin still talk sey at some point now, we go ask o, how we take know sey for three years, you no go dey chapter 11? ’

During di past year, Wang don develop new product, and strategy, e don employ anoda president.

Steven Wen over di total product line na still not good as oda vendors, but na long way na im dem don do, na im Steven Wendler, wey be market researcher, Gartner Group, Stamford Conn talk sey dem dey road to recover in terms of customer attitude until dis bad quarter don happen.

Di number one priority for Wang sales na to make sure sey e hold customer wey don dey sell before.

Wanda wey dey inside, na one of di biggest asset wey dey dere, and many of dat customers remain very loyal.

But even before di latest financial trouble wey dey ground, some customers wey be sey de wan stop deir chikini installation, so oder department no go add chikini, Chris Christen wey be marketer now, wey be market analyst with Meta Group, one market research firm for Stamford, Conn.

One Wang sales man wey comot for di company for July remember sey when e try to sell products to Eastman Kodak, e do muster support from inside market, but di whole world come dey fear as dem see di ting wey dey happen.

Di more we dey see am now, e dey really bad o.

New customers, di source of higher commission for sales people, and di key to Wang's long tenure, de even dey tough.

Chris Lynch, wey be former top salesman for Wang's mainstay computer programme, na im talk sey you no fit sell VS to new customer o. Oga Lynch leave am dis summer for Oracle Systems Inc, one software developer.

Financial problem dey especially for people wey dey push Wang image system wey be sey dey convert paper to electronic document.

Konsultants talk sey di one wey better pass for image market, na im dey dere.

But sales people dey often see Wang problem say e too much for dem to dey sell.

William Tait wey be former sales manager for Indianapolis talk sey im office don sell one million image image to one pharmaceutical company wey dem dey call Eli Lilly & Co, when dem dey make di decision, all hell come loose wit di finances. He say di Lilly executives tell am sey dem no fit take di risk of Wang.

Oga Tait talk sey e no dey blame Lilly.

Buyrs have to rely on one supplier to continue to upgrade, and replace di product, e say when one company know sey e dey hard to go with Wang, for di one wey be sey e dey collect as much as one million a year for Wang, na more reason to resign.

E don be president of Eastate Homes Inc., one Indianapolis contractor.

E fit hard for person wey dey sell something make e no happy at all.

Brian Petre, one former Wang salesman for Upstate New York, talk sey: “You dey carry shoulder for di work o.

You know sey you fit comot, turn tings around.

E dey hard o when person no fit.

Di reason no concern you sell.

Di decision on its own, di problem be sey if people come down for dump, de stop to dey sell", na wetin Mike Durkan wey be sales manager for Wang's office talk.

One key for people wey dey sell something na make deir own morale boost.

Paul Hellman, one Framingham, Mass, sales, and management consultant, and author of (Ready, Aim, You Are Hired), e con talk sey di bad news be sey, de go reject you pass.

Di good news be sey no be your fault o, so e dey advise you to achieve goals.

Like e dey suggest sey make sales people wey dey do telephone call dey talk to demsef sey all wetin I wan do today na to get 50 rejection.

But Mr. Miller, new Presido, recently, e warn im sales people about negativity, our customers just dey wait us for di hidden message, e say see customer wey dey eye now say I happy to dey Wang.
