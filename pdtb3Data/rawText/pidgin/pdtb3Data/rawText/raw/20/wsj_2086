Poor investors despite deir stamp to dump takeover, make de hold tight for deir Jaguar shares.

Na di view of some analysts here wey dey drag sey Britain leader still get two U.S. motor giant wey dey struggle for am.

Ford Motor reveal yesterday sey e don raise di motor wey dey hold for Jaguar to 10.4% from 5%.

Ford, and im rival General Motors just dey put eye on top wetin dey important pass for British company.

Di latest move from GM dey push GM to complete evriday talk wey dey sele with Jaguar kwa.

GM fit reach cooperative operation pact wey be sey e don reach like two weeks, people wey know book talk am.

At dat point, investors may face long, bumpy ride.

A victor for di fight for Jaguar may not emerge until after expiry for di next year of British government take over.

Di curb dey prevent pesin wey wan buy more than 15% of Jaguar shares without permission, dis na exceptional event of rare battle," na so London analyst Christopher Will of Shearson Lehman Hutton talk.

Jaguar's American deposit receipt na 3/8 for down market na 10 3/8. (Jaguar's aDR dey make di company one of di biggest kontri for United Kingdom stock for U.S. with more than one billion of im share wey dem get.)

Jaguar top di list of people wey dey come out for U.S. over di counter market Monday ah.

And for London Stock Exchange Monday, 18.5 million de sell de sell far pass di usual amount.

Di share wey we get, na im dey make Monday heavy for us.

Last week, many of dis Jaguar shareholder collect deir money, con run.

Wahala wey Ford ardor fit dey cool, after GM con confirm en friendly negotiation wit Jaguar.

But yesterday wen de talk, e be like sey Ford never lose interest.

Both na Shearson Oga, and Stephen Reitman, wey be European motor analyst for London broder, Ubb-Phillips & Drew, just change deir advice to dey buy, sey oya, sey even though sey many small investors go see zigzag wey be sey e go hard to swallow.

But one important point na how Ford take dey react when GM wey be world largest car maker, firm firm for di proposed deal with Jaguar.

For di moment, Ford executives go talk small naira on top of deir reiteration sey de wan raise Ford s Jaguar stake to about 15%.

GMD suppose to inject like 200 million (about 300 million) by acquiring some JAMB share, den conquer di JAMB promise of an eventual 30 stake.

Analysts believe sey car makers too go create joint venture to develop new executive model, e go double di yearly output of 50,000 cars.

Guaguar people go need to give dat kind big, big agreement.

Ford fit challenge di proposal if holders, and U.K. government gree to drop di anti takeover early, I tink sey Ford dey come out with full gun blazing, Oga, Reitman talk sey, ford want Jaguar well, well o, wey be sey na between 20% and 30% of Jaga na im fit give Ford enough vote to stop di GM deal.

GM fit counter di law.

Den, Oga Will say you dey see di difference between two very rich, very determined international companies o, e believe sey di share wey dey Jaguar fit zoom dey between between #8 and #10 ($12.20) to $15.80.

E get small value wey dey for di jaguar side even though sey de don run, recently, na im Doug Johnson, wey be fund manager for Seattle based Safeco Asset Management, talk.

At di moment, e wan keep di firm, 180,000 Jaguar wey get.

Di risk na sey if GM don enter agriment with Jaguar well, well, e go fit knock on top di U.S. rival sey e go like to attack Jaguaru small, small, especially if na very attractive proposition Saab dey for London Nomura Research Institute.

E tink sey Saab-Sania AB on Friday go announce di sale of 50% of im car division to Ford, di company don dey discuss widin cooperation for months.

Clifford Schwarz, president and chief investment officer for C-S Capital Adviser, two weeks ago, e sell Cincinnati firm 107,100 Jaguar ADR for about 10 percent of wetin dey hold hold wen dem buy am for 4 7/8 for May. I bin tink sey di possibility of against di fight, na im come small.

Of course, dat was before Ford's latest move.
