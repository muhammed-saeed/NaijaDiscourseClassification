12Kay Peter mountins and e mash go anoda hill. But na only goat for hill fit mash am pass.12

Afta yu don climb well-well, yu go si sey yu dey enjoy yorsef with golden ass wey dey under one shuku-shuku for sky.

Dis place na 12 miles from back of di hill kountry, but na Ms. Peterson and six oda pipol ride am komot for only two hours.

Dis one na Ms. Peterson talk am sey na wetin e be all about.

Twelve hundred miles (a rangers) for one Napa County, Calif., state park dey among di many people wey no dey too share di enthusiasm.

Dis dry season, dem blame bikers for one accident for Napa County park wey motor spoil for road wey dem close to bikers.

Dem go kill di animal, di biker go run, dem nor go si anytin.

Plenty park near San Francisco dey force people wey dey park to stop road. Dem dey use things wey dem dey call bomb take dey block road and dem dey use am dey stop fast, fast, and anyhow waka wey dem dey ride.

De don even send helicopter o after hiker, and equestrian complain sey de dey drive am from road.

Ste Fiala wey be di coordinator for East Bay Regional Park District don yarn sey na wahala we dey so.

Two years ago, district decide to limit di bike make e dey burn for di road wey dey inside 65,000 hilly acres.

From about 200,000 to 200,000, di mountin wey dey U.S. go dey grow to 10 million in 1990.

At least half of dat growth go don happen for only three years now.

Di wahala wey dey happen for di national conservation movement na one of di biggest wahala wey don ever happen for di country.

Many of dem na people wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey dey engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey be engineer engineer, wey

But di bicycle number, safety worry, and fear sey e go spoil, sey from Sierras to di Eastern Seaboard, sey make dem stop am for back country.

Di key to di matter be sey di okada, di okada, di okada, di okada, di okada, di okada, di okada, di okada, di okada, di okada, di okada, di okada, di okada, di okada, di okada, di okada, di okada go, di waka go, di waka go, di waka go, di waka go.

Person wey sabi ride bicycle fit jump come out from where dead body dey and where e no suppose fall put.

Dis na some of di tins wey we take dey waka on-top di hill wey dey kause wahala for person wey dey waka fast-fast go reach 40 miles (as e dey do for doz wey dey waka fast, but e dey kause wahala for people wey dey waka fast-fast).

Wise men for di whole kountry dey shaut more-more as dem dey klose di gates.

Di state of California follow by di lead of some regional parks, e recently adopt law wey almost lock all the road wey we dey pass from state park to mountain ike.

Di travel go mostly carry dem go road wey person dey use for inside motor.

Most oda states don take similar ban.

Bicycle no dey join for road wey dey for National Park.

Even U.S. Forest Service, wey de talk sey dem dey do “multiple-use ” philosophy, na im dey give motor motor wey carry many miles across di U.S., dem don begin close some land to di bike, even some part for di Pacific Crown Trail wey dey popular from California to Canada.

Many of dis closing na after vigorous anti-bike lobbying by conservation organisations, di politically potent Sierra Club among dem.

Sierra don dey instrumental wit im goment to secure many of di California ban.

De don dey do one round campaign to beat back one proposal wey Utah Bike Group dey push to allow cycle for federal, designated wilderness areas wey dey now ban.

But Sierra katakata don cause wahala for organization o, e don talk sey 17% of im 500,000 member wey dey on top mountain na im own 500,000.

For dis one wey don happen for di club recently, di club come soften di anti-bike rhetoric. For example, e no dey again for di same category like okada, okada, okada, okada, okada, okada, okada, okada, okada, okada, okada.

But di club still dey insist sey public lands go dey inside di bike, except sey dem study di bike say e no go injure anybody, or oder users, I get mountain oka, but as I don dey climb up, and down on top, na fire wey dey burn on top, na im Gene Coan, wey dey Sierra dey headquarter for San Francisco dey echo di concerns of many members.

People wey dey feel sey make dem ban cyclists for one area, dem no dey look di whole picture. Mark Langton wey be di editor for Mountain and City Biking magazine for Kano Park, Calif.

Mr. Langton dey among the people wey dey ride machine wey first taste wilderness as person wey dey climb or pack.

E say fellow bikers dey show di same wahala for di land wey dem show sey dem be hiker, many dey applaud sey conservation community go just dey look dem like enemy.

To fight back, activists like Mr. Langton dey form groups to lobby land managers on top access issue, and undertake education programme to show sey di bike fit share share.

Oga Langton group, Concerned Off-Road Bicyclers Association, don do petition make dem continue to open Santa Monica Mountain wey be sey dem go close.

Kings group for Montana, Idaho, Michigan, Massachusetts don do similar concession na Tim Blumenthal, wey be mountain biker for Bicycling magazine.

Dis group don dey try to improve di image of di mountain okada, for San Francisco-Arba, for one park wey cyclists dey hide put dis summer okada, dem don do volunteer patrol to help rangers obey law, and to school riders in di proper trail etiquette.

Even staunch anti-bike Sierra sef concede sey na 10% of all di riders cause most of di wahala.

While some of dem na renegade riders wey simply dey shalenge law, very bad riding simply dey reflect ignorance wey person fit correct through education, and peer pressure, naim Jim Hasenauer wey be di director of International Mountain Biking Association, na im talk sey I tink sey we dey progress.

E go don tay wey e go dey vex well, well when, ten years ago, some Marin County riders con make one kind machine wey be like tyre, wey get fat tyre, wey be like rubber, and multigear.

De want machine wey go allow dem to pedal come rugged, den inaccessible to cycle.

Dem get machine wey dey work well-well, wey dey responsive and wey dey stable and wey dey easy to ride pass dat tin wey dey taya.

When the bicycle first enter mass production for 1981, they dismiss them as fada.

Last year, 25% of di 10 million ike wey dem sell for U.S., na mountain ike.

For California, bellwether market, dem get more than 80% of all bike sales.

Di majority of di bike no dey even put am for top of di level.

People wey dey serve God dey like dem well, bikos dem no dey waste time for traffic, dem dey run pass where road dey and dem dey roll small-small tyre wey no smooth at-all pass where tyre dey.

Wicked Butte, population 1,200 na bash of sport.

One estimate, everybody here dey under 50 own at least one bike.

Di town dey for di Mountain Bike Hall of Fame and e dey host di yearly Tyre Bike Week.

Na for dis dry season jambor, jambor, jambor, jambor, jambor, jambor, jambor, jambor, jambor, jambor, jambor, jambor, jambor, jambor.

David Lindsey wey be di chairman for di Fat tyre Bike celebration, muses say di ting go dey popular for di bike, dey use technology, and nostalgia. Mountain oklok dey comfortable like paperboy wey you born small pikin, but e go fit do pass dat one.
