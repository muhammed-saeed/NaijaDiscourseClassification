Oyinbo people, na important decision wey we go take to make dis one fall.

For di new meeting wey di World Bank and International Monetary Fund, di Bush administration don yarn sey im go decide by year end di next increase for di IMF capital base.

While di U.S. go increase ehm, e no go reach di 12 billion hey wey di IMF ask for double its $90 billion capital, di administration go gree to increase am.

Dis one go dey on top di Brady Plan and G7 exchange rate intervention and e go dey on top Mexico, Poland, and oders.

IMF get several reasons why dem dey ask for increase.

E don dey affect how people for developing country dey feel since di 1970 'lockdown.'

Di size and speed of disburst go accelerated further under di Brady plan wey bin come out big, and before disburst go reach countries wey dey approved.

At least three factors don encourage IMF to insist on increased capital.

First e dey drag sey make dem increase di capital base for world financial market, wey be sey na some kind big ting e dey carry.

Second, di World Bank latest $75 billion capital increase, $14 billion from di U.S., e don drop di IMF wey be sey na di first fiddle for international financial institution.

Third, IMF go like meet Japan say make dem give am more property (currently four percent).

Japan don support one big business wey dem dey call IMF for developing country debt, and na one of di biggest financial resource wey IMF dey support for developing countries.

While international politics dey argue about capital increase, clear economic case against am.

Oppositions of di increase dey argue sey IMF dey do central planning, dey support ineffective government.

Dem dey ask weda IMF get any role for developing countries, give am di original mandate to assist industrial countries for balance of payment.

Oppositions show sey money don already dey wey be sey we go fit do better, better, better reform.

Dem worry sey new IMF funding of developing countries, na im go just con end wey be sey na reschedulable commercial bank, one bad trade wey dey everywhere.

Dem believe microeconomics wey dey solve problem for market, investment climate, and management, na im be di key to developing country growth, no be IMF dey focus on top trade deficit, quarterly, and government debt.

Dem dey point to many developing countries wey dey get money, dey collect tax, dey regulate demsef, dey suffer for different different IMF.

Decision on top increase for IMF capital base traditionally, na administration dey do am wit subsequent authorization by Congress.

For di last U.S. Senate authorization for 1983, na one political donnybrook wey carry six billion housing community along with am to get enough vote.

Di politics of di 1990 govnor dey likely be like di one wey dey before.

Liberal lawmakers may support di stabilising, quasi-governmental role of di IMF on two condition, sey administration go give assurance sey liberal Democrat support no go dey for dem for re-lection campaign, and sey di legislation address wit dollar for social, and environmental concerns.

Government go give right to support, or to suffer deir party president for election year.

A U.S. decision to refuse di IMF capital increase, or limit am to 25%, na im go bring big change for international economic policy, and e no go easy for you to take am lightly.

Commitee go worry on top wetin concern G7 coordination process, and di stability of world financial market.

Because commercial banks, and developing countries governments believe sey dem go get any capital increase, small -small IMF mission go leave dem feel small change.

Further, U.S. go stop capital increase (and transfer of capital to Japan), go make Japan parabol on top economic burden wey go soon affect dem.

On top sey one go increase IMF capital, e go add join di central economic role of multilateral institution for developing countries.

Wit di increase, even more na di developing country energy, and talent go comot from developing profitable economic system to set up economic planning ministry wey be sey na IMF go approve am.

Wite ante fit slow economic development even further, as countries dey delay to allow richer, richer, richer, richer support.

Remaining servants suppose take position before administration year end.

Di matter too dey important to di financial and budget ministry wey dey fight on top di capital increase instead of di plan.

If doomy no support increase for IMF capital, den na incumbent on dem to talk up now, and explain di alternative.

Mr. Malpass dey direct di Republican staff of di Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
