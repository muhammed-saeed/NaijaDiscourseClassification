Why di stock market just dey volatile?

Yesterday, Dow Jones Industrial Average do one dance wey e don dance reach 60.25 point before lunch time and most of di drop wey dey happen in 25 minutes.

E con rebound reach only 1865 point.

And dat swing wey be sey na Friday, 190,58 point, na Monday 88,12 point recovery.

Sey na madness, sey in one hour, you go fit whack well, well,‚Äù na so Stanford Calderwood wey be di chairman for Trinity Investment Management Corp, Boston talk.

And maybe it's here to stay.

Richard Bernstein wey be senior quantitative analyst for Merrill Lynch & Co, talk sey my gut feel sey we go dey live wit dis swing for some time.

Many reasons dey for market wey dey jump up, and down wey be sey new market dey, sey dem dey buy, sey dem dey buy, sey dem dey buy, sey dem dey buy computer, sey dem dey sell, and crowd psychology.

But most of dem na one topic namely liquidity, di ability to enter, and out of market quick.

The price of goods dey go up and down so, because investors dey use wayo take dey collect money, and now dem dey act for concert.

Peter Anderson wey be di pension fund management arm of IDS Financial Services Inc, we dey watch di same indicator, and dey listen to di same prognostics.

Like lemming, we dey go di same way, and dat, naturally, de dey bring price.

Institution, wey dey sell most business now, dey count on top sey na big block block dem dey sell for eyebolism.

But when de discover sey market no be deir own liquid as de suppose be, market dey jump.

For Monday like, Howard Ward, one principal for Scudder, Stevens & Clark, na im come find out sey you no fit buy blue chip for price wen you say you no pay, and when many firms dey pay, Monday sudden rally just come out.

Di trading for future, and option, some people believe, e fit add to volatility.

Investors believe sey dem fit rely on dem for inside and outside di stock market without sey dem sell di stock, dat is, di way of staying liquid even when dem own stocks.

Dis, and oder modern trading method wey be sey de dey promote dramatic change of di asset, na im George Douglas, first vice president for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, sey di one wey dey do easy, na im go come out easy o, so dat de go get increase of higher volatility inside stock market.

One new investment wey dem dey call allocation, shift portfolio weight between stocks, bond, and cash, when computer model say one dey price well, well.

For example, di First Quadrant Corp, one asset allocator wey dey for Morristown, N.J. e con talk sey na kpako e take increase kampe position on top di aggressive account to 75% from 55% to take increase am on Friday.

E add anoder 5% on Monday before stocks come together.

When dem do am, di firm come reduce di stock wey dey hold am to about 70%.

One example of institutional hunger for liquidity na portfolio insurance now, most of the credit.

Before di 1987 crash, an estimated 60 billion in institutional money was managed under dis hedging technique.

Di idea na to insure di price of portfolio by selling future, when stock price drop, e go reduce di price of stocks.

But for October 1987, when portfolio insurers rush come sell at di same time, dem overtake stock, and future market.

But even today, institution dey quietly do portfolio insurance, dey rush go, rush go market, rush go.

Others dey do index arbitrage, dey take advantage of price difference between stocks, and future.

Unlike traditional buy, and sell strategy, all of dem above na to give liquidity by buying, and selling stocks in crunch.

But institutions say wall street broker no dey gree make market.

Brokers no dey deny dat one.

Wall street tradas talk sey, with institutional broker price wey dey lower dan di 1970 naira, securities firm no fit take di risk of buying too much stock sey, I tink sey everybody get small leery, sey na Shearon Lehmann Hutton Inc, di institution don drive (commission) down to di point wey be sey e no make sense to do capital. Tom Gallagher wey be senior executive vice president for institutional trading, Openheimer & Co, sey why meh I take am easy to do investment?

Anyting you dey see, na risk.

If liquidity also comot from exchange exchange, many traders talk sey circuit breaker na to cause sudden volatility after di 1987 crash wey happen on top stock market bin go down Friday.

Circuit breakers cause 30 minutes closing for trading in Standard & Poor's 500 stock future contract as e market dey fall.

With future trading stall, you go fit only sell stocks to cut exposure to market, one money manager talk sey na big wahala for people wey dey tink sey dem no fit get im trade.

E be like sey de put you inside one room with gorilla come tell you sey three doors dey to exit, na so one Chicago based customer talk, de con say by way, two of di doors don lock.

Di takeover mania too dey add to di volatility.

:UAL Corp. Na one better example.

Value na one out of evry buyout target, di airline stock na almost $280 a share.

When di deal enter trouble, stock tumble, e close for $198 yesterday.

Suppose be sey na UAL dey sell near di money wey dey sell now.

But na so e go still be for people wey dey buy and sell wetin dem get.

Scott Black, one value-... money manager wey dey head Delphi management Inc, e dey yarn sey for people wey dey invest on top fundamental, dem no dey change di price of stock wey dey dey go day by day.

Some experts say market no dey hot like any other thing wey dey happen.

Hans Stoll, wey be finance professor for Vanderbilt University, na im dey talk sey di current volatility for U.S. market, compare to di 1930'something wey be sey de bin introduce different different instrument like, option, and future, sey I just no fit believe sey dis latest one wey dey happen for financial market, na im dey cause any of dis volatility.

And Robert D. Arnott wey be president of asset allocation, first quadrant, e yarn sey before Friday tailpin, daily volatility on top di New York Stock Exchange, in recent weeks, e don dey go up.

Some people dey ignore sey 50 percent increase, na di same as e dey when stock market low.

John J. Phelan Jr. wey be di chairman for Big Board, talk sey 1988, and 1989, na two of di lowest volatile years wey don dey since 30 to 40 years.

But di low vain volatility wey Mr. Phelan dey yarn now, e no get any comfort for rapid stock market matter like di one wey don happen since last week.

In addition, Sanford Grossman, one Wharton School finance professor, na im talk sey volatile price of stock go continue as e dey drop small, small demand from institutions wey be sey dey go out sey I get billion dollar for stocks wey be sey de dey sell.

Some people dey feel sey liquidity no dey.

For 1936, John Maynard Keynes write sey of di maxims of orthodox finance, no, e dey cheap pass di fetish of liquidity, e dey lead investors to di short, term price of musical chairs, e dey call am, no be long term fundamental valuation.
