Internal Revenue Service wan restructure imsef more dan one private corporation.

Di tax office still dey yarn sey na di latest step wey dem go take find out from private sector na im go take ogbonge position to guide di 120,000 staff wey be sey dey owe dem, and one chief information officer to update di information system wey be sey na im be di biggest computer data base for di world.

Di IRS also yarn sey e go create di position of chief financial officer wey be sey de go hire am from inside di agency.

IRS Commitee, Fred T. Goldberg talk sey di change, e dey intended to bring accountability to di agency wey get annual budget of more than $5 billion, and dey collect about $1 trillion a year.

My assessment, and everybody own na sey we no get di kind information wey be sey let us use take form and execute our budget well, well, Oga Goldberg talk sey and we no get internal control and discipline wey be sey we need to spend five billion properly.

Oga Goldberg wey be oga for di Independent Electoral Commission for July, don disturb di way e dey look di inefficiency, waste, and lack of coordination among di big federal government branch office.

Di IRS dey operate one computer system wey e don dey do since 1961 wey be sey e don dey modern for many years.

And di agency wey operate throughout fiscal 1989 wit $360 million budget shortfall, na im dey for hiring since last fall.

Di new commissioner dey yarn sey on top how di agency dey use di resources, e go try wella to increase tax revenue by more tings.

I tink sey you go see big difference for di budget formulation, and execution process wey in turn, I believe sey di money go grow well, well.

IRS dey hope to fill di new position soon.

Customarily, e go appoint career civil servants from within di agency, but Mr. Goldberg talk sey im dey plan to "scourage di world" for di chief information officer and di comptroller.

Aldough di job go maybe pay between $70,000, and $80,000 a year, but di govnors dey sure sey dem go fit attract top, top candidate from private sector.

You dey tell person sey de fit spend di next three, four, five, six years of deir life on top di most expensive and costly information system on top civil side ever, Mr. Goldberg con talk sey on top di comptroller side, you dey develop, dey do work on top of six billion budget.
