Oda analysts talk sey di Indian leader fit retain power wit small majority, or dem go force am to rule as di main partner for coalition with oder party.

Electrical for dis big, different, and sweet nation dey always struggle.

Much depend on di opposition, a difren regional and political parties led by former Govnor Vishwanath Pratap Singh.

Di one wey dey biggest na sey election go dey for or against Mr. Gandhi and im five years for power; e go be five years for power, dey promise, dey disappoint, de go dey fall well, well.

Four days after one unusual parliamentary defeat for di ruling party, Oga Mahati bin call election for lower house of parliament on Nov 22 and 24.

Dem go do election for different states on one of di two days. (di lower house go expire in January, and di upper house go appoint).

Election go tough well, well for di 45 years old prime minister and congress (I), wey different, different kind of India don rule for 42 years of independence.

After landlide win for 1984 for poll wey dem do after im mama don die, im name na Indira Gandhi, Oga Gandhi see as im name begin to dey popular for di roller coaster.

Im promise to make India clean for our time no be small wahala.

Im promise to clean up local administration, and indian politics, plus im own party, na yeye one o.

Im name na Mr.

Clearing image for one arm trick back wey go be one major campaign now.

Some analyst dey predict sey dis one wey dem dey call dis one wey dem dey call dis one wey dem dey call dis one wey dem dey call dis one wey be sey na petty policeman, na corrupt revenue collector na im dey cause am for di country.

Dis one fit be big vexnashon against admin failure.

Even if Congress (I) still get power for government, Mr. Gandhi get power to push through major initiative, e fit be sey na small, small initiative na im dey push pass.

Economic analysts call im trailblazing liberalisation of di Indian economy incomplete, and many people dey hope for major liberalisation if e come back firmly to power.

Lok Sabha, abi na lower house of parliament na im get 542 elected and two admonition.

For 1984, Congress (I) win 405 seats, na im get di biggest win for Indian democracy.

Na panic start di landslide for India dat time.

Oga, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God, Baba God.

For di previous three general elections, na so, similar national issue con make di vote come out.

For 1971, Congress Party win after India win for Bangladesh war.

For 1977, dem trow Mrs. Gandhi outside office afta e don do 19 months emergency rule and for 1980 afta im successor slap am for three years, e come back to office.

Most political analyst yarn sey if Mr. Gandhi opposition dey favour single candidates for most precinct, Congress (I) go lose big ting.

But if opposition still dey, Congress (I) fit win small majority, or lead coalition government.

Chimanbhai Mehta, one parliamentarian, and before-before Gandhi ally, e go win only 150 seat, quarter of di house if opposition people wey be single candidate for 80% of di race win.

Analyst talk sey opposition go struggle dis week to unite, and im go succeed only when e announce final list of parliamentary candidate.

Di arm kickback matter likely be one of di big koko for di campaign, but e no too dey common for di average Indian voters.

For 1986, India sign one $1.4 billion contract with Abbofors one unit of Nobel Industries, Sweden AB, to buy 400 artillery pieces.

Di contract na two prime minister o, and e suppose dey free of commission, or agent price.

For April 1987, evidence come out say dem pay am commission.

Di opposition deny sey dem use di money take bribe Indian government people, one allegation wey dem deny wey be sey Mr. Gandhi administration nko.

But many of im statement on top di matter for Parliament later, na documentary evidence show say e dey wrong.

Di gist now don fade, e don get flare, but new tori wey don carry am enter front page, and dat one don help galvanize opposition, wey last week bin block two constitutional amendment bill.

Na di first time in 20 years wey be sey de win all dose government bill.

Bofors don become kukuruku for government for country wey kuku dey for phone, job, even school.

Dat one na di kind disappointment wey many Indians dey feel for Oga, Gandhi wey dem happy to elect and support for im first two years for power.

Im term don cause no be small gbege for politics, for economy, for military front and e don chalk up some tins.

But di average India man get strong hope for di young leader and e promise sey e go help di government and di ruling party to dey good and to dey corrupt.

: En failure for dat two areas, and sometimes e do wetin make many Indians suffer.

We no like Congress (I), sooraji Jat, wey be farmer for western state of Gujarat, na im talk sey Congress government dey take di bread wey be sey de dey chop, no be sey de dey give us support.

When light no dey, light no dey, road no dey, government tell us make we forget am.

Di biggest ting wey dey go for Mr. Gandhi, and Congress (I) party na di poor reputation of di opposition.

Even if na unites for election, im coherence go be temporary.

When Congress (I) lose di 1977 election following Mrs. Gandhi hate emergency rule, a similar coalition come take power, come disintegrate.

Many Indian people dey fear for dat experience.
