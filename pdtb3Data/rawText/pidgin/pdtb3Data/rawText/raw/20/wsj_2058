National Aeronautics and Space Administration talk sey one kind computer virus don enter one of im network, e don dey spread anti-nuclear message wey concern im Galilee space probe wey dem go launch today.

Charles Redmond, one NASA spokesman, na im talk sey di agency discover di virus on Monday ontop computer network wey dey collectively call internet, and dem bin expect sey 100 university center go dey infected by today.

Even though sey network no dey for computer wey dey operate galilee, or shuttle, part of di network go dey carry analysis of Galilee data once di machine get space born.

Oga Redmond talk sey di intruder never do anytin o, but di agency fear sey garbage Data fit replace real Data, e say e fit take one day for one computer security manager to remove di virus from computer system.

Di truth be sey, among di biggest ones wey don hit one research network, na only Digital Equipment Corp wey dey use digital vax/VMS operating system, na im cause am.

De no dey related to di plenty public sickness wey dey come out for di last year for Arpanet, one big network wey researchers for university, lab, and government agency dey use take dey do different tings around di world.

For di lingo of computer security, di NASA intrude is technically a computer worm, Mr. Redmond said.

E get one worm wey dey stay for computer wey dey spread by boring viruses wey dey enter other computer wey dey use network.

Di galileo worm, e fit be sey na one computer for France hook up for NASA Space Physics Network, Oga Redmond yarn.

APOSTLE PAUL talk sey di worm wey dey Galilee no dey affect computer, computer or any oda government agency because de don change deir system to dey reject worm.

But Oga Redmond yarn sey di worm don chop university wey never vote to make di changes.

Michael Alexander wey be senior editor for computer computer, wey dey sell one book talk sey de tell am sey di worm dey enter computer centre na im dey look for one kind password like dat wey be di same name wey person wey dey use computer dey get.

If e find one enter di system, e go display screen wen one user log onto say woms Against Nuclear Killers, you talk of times of peace for all, and den prepare for war.

In addition, Mr. Alexander say di worm dey send strange message to oder machines for centre like sey George Orwell be optimist, or no feed bat dis night.

Di worm dey also look for elementary password wey go give more privilege for person wey dey use am.

Di password dey inside di system wen dem put am, but e suppose dey replaced as di system dey up, and running.

If e find one of di password, Oga Alexander say di worm go do am like change user password to random number, stop am to dey sign up to network.

APOSTLE PAUL talk sey on Monday, about four computer center, dey affected.

Today, di number don grow to 40, today di number suppose to 100.

NNASA talk sey e go take like one week before e go know exactly how many centre dey for di 6,000 connections wey dey Internet, and how much of di wahala wey dey happen for internet.

Antinuclear Activists don para on top di launch of di Galileo space probe for Jupiter because e dey use plutonium to give light to di craft.

Actors dey fear sey if di shuttle wey carry Galilee dey go on top of di earth go explode, or if galilee fall enter ground di second time when e dey fly near di earth, di level of pluton go fall enter di atmosphere.

Dem delay am two times for Galilee, bikos of one engine wey don spoil, but na bikos of di weather.

12Saul tok sey Galilee worm nor get pawa to do anytin wey e won do.12

Oga Alexander wey be computer science talk sey hackers don follow SPAN before now.

E say di Chaos Computer Club for West Germany, once e manage enter SPAN, come do some kind tins wey be sey de change value of pipol, come mess up some of di calculation.
