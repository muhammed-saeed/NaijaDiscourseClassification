Wi dey sorry to report sey on Monday, Presido Bush accept di resignation of William Allen as chairman for di U.S. Civil Rights Commission.

Oga Allen, appoint by Presido Reagan say e don tire as e dey followguerrilla tactics of im enemies.

Im latest speech, provocative finale na Black Friday?

Animals?

Homosexuals?

Wetin be Minority? Wetin cause kworel when di title come out.

Mr. Allen's commissioner don vote to call im unresponsive, "thoughtless, yeye, yeye inflammatory inflammatory" na im di oga of di unguided missile wey be chairman, Don Edwards, di California Democrat, don warn Oga Allen sey di talk go be outside di scope of di commission commission o. Thomas Stoddard, wey be di chairman of Lambda Legal Defense Fund, na im dey yarn di yarn sey na outside di scope of di commission commission o.

We don even read di speech.

Oga Allen start am wit warning give im host, one California church group wey dey oppose homosexual rights.

E say oder participants for di conference no believe sey right of Americans should be guaranteed to citizens wey be homosexual, but sey I mean to persuade you to di opposite view.

E recall to di audience afeada sey na now wey we don finally recognize sey American black people get right, we need to do di same for animal o, oga Allen object to dis analogy because e be like sey na charity, of human being rights on top of dis level, weda na black matter, weda na homosexual matter o.

E say di title of im speech na to make am point say America get right as individual, no be as member of some select group.

Di tok of im speech o, e criticise di idiocy of notions of protected groups in society, as opposed to individual equality or, as e put am for common destiny as America, instead of to lobby for special treatment, e say homosexuals, and oders should try to ensure equal treatment under di law, and not for special privileges wey go risk government interference.

Dis one no be like antihomosexual sex.

Wetin really dey happen for here?

Di three wey dey important pass to understand about Oga Allen be sey im na very, very conservative intellectual, three threat to di liberal establishment.

Oga Allen, wey dey teach government for prestigious University for California, and go remain member of di commission, e don dey drag leg say civil rights na human right.

Last, last when e defend one Indian girl wey dem don adopt from non-Indian parents.

Oga Allen kwik-kwik attack di liberal establishment again, which somehow elevated di vague notion of Indian right over di rights of individual Indian.

Di division wey be sey Oga, Allen get sey we dey inside dis kwayamasta view, and di visa litigation approach di civil rights group.

True, true, di gap big sotay Oga Allen critics no gree enter di debate.

De no dey take am make yeye o.

De try to run am comot for Washington, na embarrassment to di original purpose of deir own movement.

We hope sey di next head of di Civil Rights Commission go do di right thing wey Mr. Allen dey do on top equality of civil rights.
