De put down for di book wey dey di book wey be Kissing Nature Goodbye, by Stephen Macdonald (Leisure & Arts, Sept. 27) and di book wey dey inside di book dey talk sey na human being dey make warm up for di world.

Na so de just see am?

If human being no dey, di weather for dis world go dey hot well, well?

E clear sey no!

Some 20,000 years now wey be di last ice age.

Ice block no fall for North America, northern Europe and Asia.

Dis kold wey dey happen for evriwhere for di world, na natural tin. Nobody go blame am for di hundred thousand men wey dey hunt mamon and skata for inside cave.

Further, no bell never come out to announce di end of dis great, wonderful phenomenon wey dey happen for di world.

I dey bow to no one for my body to show us wetin dey happen to us for dis world, but if we dey serious about how di world take dey warm, make wi look di big picture, make wi nor let Dominant Culture stop us for di big-big tings wey dey happen for di world, wey be sey na only model we go dey talk about.
