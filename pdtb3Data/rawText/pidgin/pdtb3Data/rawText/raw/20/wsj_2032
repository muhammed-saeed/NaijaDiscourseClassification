According by one person wey dey di meeting, eastern plan na financial over optimistic.

Asked about di consultants report, one Eastern spokeswoman say we absolutely disagree, she say de don do "overimply and make some erroneous assumptions wey de dey make deir analysis completely off base."

For one later news conference here, Frank Lorenzo, wey be chairman of Eastern parent, Texas Air Corp, e con talk sey eastern, e don dey beyond im plan to enter operation again, and predict sey e go come out from chapter 11 wey be sey de bin dey operate with more service pass as e suppose be.

We dey inside di process of discussing an amended plan with di creditors, and anticipate dat amended plan shortly, Mr. Lorenzo tell tori people sey we dey do meeting, and we dey surpass wetin we plan.

For July, Eastern and im creditors con gree on top one restructuring plan wey dem dey call for Eastern to sell $1.8 billion ah, and to collect tax wey go reach two percent of wetin dey before.

But wen dem sell some part for di East Coast shuttle, wey dey inside Philadelphia hub and some oda aeroplane, Eastern part fall for groun.

E no fit sell South America road, one of di major asset wey dem mark for disposal.

One last minute snag for inside negotiations with AMR on top one unrelated lawsuit wey dey between American and anoda Texas Air unit, na im cause di deal to fall.

Estern eventually decide sey e go dey keep and operate di way wey be sey e go dey use less money to maintain di road.

E go still leave Eastern, one big, big airline wen e don dey on top di scale one wey bin dey under di initial plan.

Di change in di condition mean sey di reorganization plan wey dey before, dem go change am.

Since den, Eastern don dey negotiate with creditors on top of revision, but di creditors committee don dey hit on top di revision.

Di committee get two group wey e dey call on top to analyze eastern plans.

Di two of dem say di new plan no go work.

Ernst & Young say eastern planning go miss im projections, before intrest, tax, and recapture by $100 million, and dat eastern plan no get comfort level according to one source wey dey inside yesterday session.

Experts from Goldman Sachs estimated eastern go miss di same mark by $120 million to $135 million according to Source Source.

Experts talk sey dem dey expect sey Eastern go issue new money to take cover am, sey e go generate small, small money wey no dey expected.

Oyinbo go increase too o, dat is to say maintenance, because east get old fleet.

For di tori, Mr. Lorenzo and Eastern President, Phil Bakes present for far rosier assessment.

Flight attendants, pilots, gateman wey wear spiffy blue uniform, dem say eastern don do pass wetin dey inside and e dey fill seat.

Starting next month, Eastern go begin to dey fly 775 a day instead of di previous one wey be sey de bin yarn 700.

Oga Baka, e no gree release eastern, but e say e no expect say eastern go enter money from asset sales wey be sey dey hold for escort.

Dis account dey hold one hundred million hey mainly from asset sales.

Di plan wey Eastern wan pursue, e say, de dey call for eastern to get three nine million in cash by year end.

Both e, and Oga Lorenzo bin yarn sey dem go confirm dis plan for January.

For di talk wey dem do on top matter wey concern how dem take dey collect money, Oga, Lorenzo, na im dey yarn o after di show say we go must see how dem take dey talk, but e con add sey no be sey de dey accept di plan o.

E must be taken by di court.

Under bankruptcy law, Eastern don get exclusive right for one period wey be to develop im own reorganization plan.

Dat time, de don extend am once, and I fit extend am again.

If eastern get credit, court confirmation of dia plan go sharp, sharp.

But creditors free to press deir own plan, or di court go fit ignore both sides, con take deir own.

Any event, some people wey know di matter, weda di court go do by January as Oga Lorenzo and Oga Bakes dey yarn.
