When Soviets talk sey deir last soldier don comot for Afghanistan for February, all of dem come dey talk sey dem dey good, but one international choir of euphoria come drown all of dem.

Na Soviets' Vietnam, na Kabul regime go fall.

Millions of refugees go kpakpa deir house.

One government go fight enter Kabul.

People wey buy am now, dem no know.

Eight months afta Gen. Boris Gromov waka pass di bridge enter U.S.S.R. Soviet army still dey for Kabul, but refugee still dey for dia camp and dem go soon get freedom again.

But e nor get anytin wey fit stop Kabul pawa to komot kwik-kwik.

Di Soviet leaders con talk sey de go support deir Kabul client by force, and do.

U.S. talk sey e go support di resistance well, well and e no go hard.

Wit February 1987 U.N. dey relate to Afghanistan, di Soviet Union get everytin wey need to consolidate permanent control.

Di terms wey dey di Geneva accord dey leave Moscow dey free to provide im clients for Kabul wit assistance wey include return of Soviet ground forces, but e go mean sey make U.S. and Pakistan stop to help dem.

Di only fly wey dey inside Soviet Union (EU) na di last minute join one unilateral American cave dat U.S. go help di resistance go on top am until di Soviet aid wey Kabul get, go continue.

But as soon as de sign di agreement, American goment sharperly reduce aid.

For February 1989, when Soviets talk sey de don do deir pullout finish, U.S. come cut am further.

No be so Soviets dey do.

Gen. Gromov imsef yarn sey Soviet army go leave behind more than $1 billion military equipment and installation for Kabul regime.

Since di troop withdrawal, Moscow don add $200 to 300 million hey o since February, dat na di total amount wey be U.S. aid to di resistance in nine years.

Dis one include wetin Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov go fetch say new peaceful long range weapon, plus more than 800 SCUD missile.

For May, Moscow don deliver 1,000 truck, about 100 tank, artillery, hundreds of oda bombers.

Later dat month, e add tank tank, plus 120 T-72 tank, plus 40 BMP state of di world infantry.

For September, one new Rehoboam wey be Reinforced Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessing Blessings.

For some weeks now, Moscow don add FROG-7B missile, di bomber version of di An-12, Mig-23bn high altitude plane, Mig-29s, wey fit fly for Pakistan U.S.SR, and Sukhoi SU-27 fighter bombers wey fit fly for Mig-29s.

Moscow say dis one na all necessary to protect Kabul regime against diguerrilla resistance.

Dem know sey na only wetin dem write for the paper dem dey write every month.

But dis nor bi di whole kountry for Afghanistan and na only Kabul remain.

Dem train and train all di unit for U.S.R. and oda East Babilon nashon and dem bi thirty thousand to forty thousand.

Di regime don establish paramilitary force wey get more than 100,000, plus 35,000 Soviet Soviet troops for inside di Interior Ministry (KHAD/WAD), wey still dey under 1,500 Soviet Soviet Soviet officers.

Even if not all dese group dey committed to di regime, de dey dependent on am now.

Dem don take thousands of Afghan children go Soviet Union, where dem dey host dia family.

Since 1981, Indian military adviser don dey assist Kabul regime.

For preparation for di withdrawal, Moscow, Kabul, and New Delhi sign two agreement for several hundred new civilian in-law wey go replace some of di more popular Soviet military wey dey dere.

Cutin military personnel too don dey active for Afghanistan since 1979.

Soviets cut deal wit Iran, future Iranian support for Soviet policy.

Di deal mean sey Shiite Sultan Ali Keshtmand go back to Afgan Province.

Also, serious questions don dey ground on top sey dem talk sey Soviet army don withdraw.

Before im Assassination for 1988, President Zia of Pakistan talk many times sey dem dey put fresh army for Afghanistan even as odas still dey withdrawn.

Dem na: Rep. Bill McCollum (R. Fla) talk sey dis one na 20,000 to 30,000 Soviet Central Asia kobo, ethnically different from Afghan kobo and de wear uniform wey no get mark.

Meanwhile, Kabul regime dey get head pass as e be before.

For dis one, American, European, Pakistani, and Saudis dey support di most extremist group. Islamic fanatics with leaders wey dey go on top of dem, dey help dem too.

: Dis heavy wahala for outside support don undermine better leadership wey be sey na small pikin dey dere.

For example, for December last year wey government put for Kandahar, dem prepare to surrender di city to some people wey no dey listen to dem.

But for di last minute, di govnor for Pakistan send Gulbuddin to Hakmatyar. E fit bi sey di extremists dey vex and dem dey beg sey make dem release am give en sojas.

Di deal fall pass, and Kandahar remain one of di main regime base.

Di resistance no be only air conditioning, but many of dem na maps, mine detector, or even gloves for winter.

Federal resistance commanders wan use guerrilla action, and deir tactics take dey wear di regime.

Instead, Pakistan s I wey dey channel dem dey push dem to attack am for Jalalabad.

Dem carry more dan 25% of the casualties, na im tori people dey report sey dem face mine field without mine detector.

Di wonder be sey no be sey di wahala wey dey shek for inside Kabul regime don start, but sey e still dey exist, dey fight at all.

Last summer, after dem don close, state department and CIA come yarn sey dem don resume military assistance to di resistance months ah, but e never know how much dem dey send am, or when e go come.

For monts, nobody fit stop breeze wey dey blow up-and-down.

So far e nor get anytin wey show sey dem dey give Stingers and all di oda tins wey dem take dey fight war.

True true, government for U.S. don tell dem before sey make government continue to dey help people. Dem talk sey the government go continue to dey help, e go depend on how the weak people go take win for the end of this year.

Moses and Kabul go don see dat information wey dey useful.

For ten years, U.S. policy don dey on top of miscalculation, on top of defence of bureaucratic, and on top of politics.

No settlement wey oder people fit force Afghan people make dem stop deir struggle.

A complete cutoff from U.S. military aid, e go just leave dem die in vain.

Build new one wey dey real, di U.S. policy long on top.

Ms. Klass, di editor and co-author of Afghanistan, di great Game Revisited, e dey direct di Freedom House programme for Afghanistan, South Asia.
