Dis na wetin dem rite for di book wey dem dey koll Majius Giroldi, wey dey lead di gang wey dem kill for Panama. Dem beri am for groun and e get sore, broken head, broken leg and rib.

Dem be im enemy group, Panamanian leader, Manuel Noriega.

Di rebel offisa slow and painful death for di headquarter of Panama Battalion-2000 squad na im Gen. Noriega, wey be U.S. govnor wit access to intelligence report, na im dem do am.

Oga Noriega don kill about 70 of im soldier wey follow for di coup according to U.S. govnors wey dey monitor crematorium, and funeral parlor for Panama City.

E dey change di place wey e dey sleep for nite pass one nite.

Women dey always prepare im food for am. E dey do evritin wey im mama dey do. E dey do Vicky Amado and im mama name na Rega.

And e dey collect di names of people wey telephone di coup makers to congratulate dem during deir brief time for en headquarter.

E go still happen to pipol wey dey opress us.

E never too tey wey Oga God for U.S. come dey vex for dem, Oga God, Noriega don dey do im power well, well and e dey quick do am.

But while di failed coup na major U.S. foreign policy embarrassment, na only di latest chapter in azantine relationship between Oga Noriega and Washington na im don extend three years.

America war on top di dictator afta two years following im indictment on top drugs charges for February 1988, na im be di legacy of dat relationship.

Before American foreign policy na to destroy Noriega, e come take cause am problem for di crucible of Panama long before before dem born am.

For most of di past 30 years, di marriage, na one of di tings wey dey make person mind come down.

For example, for 1960, when Mr. Noriega dey one elite military academy for Peru, and one spy in training for U.S. defense intelligence agency, dem catch am for inside Lima authorities on top sey dem rape and savagely beat one prostitute according to U.S. Embassy cable from dat time.

Di woman don nearly die.

But U.S. intelligence, instead of reinforcing or cutting off di new spy, e just file di report.

Mr. Noriega's tips on emerging leftist for im school, U.S. go don see am.

From dat point forward, U.S. go do practice overlooking di mistake wey Panamanian dey make.

U.S. don be friend with many rulers before, but e nor get sense at-all.

Di 55 years old Oga, Noriega, no smooth at all di shah for Iran, na im come still be Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza, as empire, na Ferdinand Marcos wey come from Philippines, or as blood comot for Haiti's Baby Doc Duvalier.

But e get pawa pass any of dem.

And of necessity: U.S. fit make mistake, and still dey hope to remove am from power, but one single mistake for im part fit kill am.

U.S. underestimate Noriega all along, Ambler Moss, before Ambassador to Panama, e don sabi di art of survival.

Keeping in America's long history of propping Mr. Noriega, latest U.S. actions don extend, rather than reduce im survival.

Mr. Noriega for don fall for 1988 sake of Panama economic situation, but as goment dey push am to push am to push am to push am again, and scapegoat for im own mismanagement.

If U.S. go don sit down do notin, e for no pass 1988, Mr. Mos contend.

E fit be sey Oga Noriega's allies don intervene to encourage some, some even to demand make di dictator continue to hold di throne.

For 1987 when one Colombian drug oga hear sey Gen. Noriega dey negotiate with U.S. to leave am as slave wey e like well well, e send am one big mahogany coffin wey e name dey.

E don cornered, di Rev. Fernando Guardia wey don lead Catholic Church opposition against Noriega talk sey America don leave am wit no help.

E dey easy to fight when you no get oder option.

En pawa big well-well for di fight, e know how American pipol dey bihave anyhow and na en fault dey kause am.

Mr. Noriega dey always talk to im friend sey patience na di best weapon wey e get against dis gring wey e get small, small belle wey e fit use take end di quarrel.

Di U.S. discover Tony Noriega for late 1959 when e dey second year for Chorrillos Military Academy for Lima, according to former U.S. intelligence people.

Di contact na through Mr. Noriega's half brother, one Panamanian diplomat wey dey for Peru, wey de dey call Luis Carlos Noriega Hurtado.

Luis Carlos, wey be sey im know sey to help Americans to advance di career of any Panamanian officer, na im dey follow Tony talk for di leftist tendencies wey e dey see for im fellow students, and especially for im officer and instructors.

Dem born one spy.

E get one kind experience wey help Oga God, Oga God, Noriega, wey im friends dey call Cara La Pina, pineapple face.

Dem born di pikin wey en papa sell give en papa. Dem karry am for di street wey dey di central market district for Panama City.

Tony na four years old pass all im fellow military cadet, and im go school because im broder no gree give im birth certificate.

E see imsef as superior to im own Peruvian classmate, many of dem wey be wayo sons dey send dem go di school wey dey very disciplined, wey French dey do as reform school.

E get one French soldier cap wey e wear wey dem dey call aproko, wey dem dey call aproko, wey dem dey call aproko, wey dem dey call aproko, wey dem dey call aproko, wey dem dey call aproko, wey dem dey call aproko, wey dem dey call aproko, wey dem dey call aproko, wey soldiers dey wear special privilege. Darien Ayala na one of di student for Peru and one long lifelong friend.

Oga Noriega relationship with American intelligence agency enter contract for either 1966, or 1967.

Im oga for di Chiriqui Province garrison, Major Omar Torrijos, na im give am one sweet, sweet assignment o, sey Oga Noriega go organise di first intelligence service for di province.

Di spy network go serve two clients o: di Panamanian government, by monitoring political opposition for di region, and U.S., by tracking di progress of Communist Party wey dey organize for United Fruit Co, for Bocas del Toros and Puerto Armuelles.

United Fruit na one of di two biggest contribution wey Panama national income dey.

No be small matter for any Panamanian leader be that.

Mr. Noriega's initial retainer na only $50 to $100 a month plus sometimes gist of liquor, or grocery gist wey American PX, one former intelligence officer talk.

Di money wey American goment dey pay, but healthy boost for im small army salary wey fellow officers dey remember na $300 to $400 monthly.

E do am very well, na Boris Martinez wey be former Panamanian colonel wey be sey na im dey manage Oga God, Noriega, and im operation na im start to dey build di file wey help am gain power.

One National Guard job na for Capt. Noriega for 1964 (na im be di chief of transit police for David City, capital of Chiriqui province), dem do tailoring for one superspray.

As e dey waka dey go taxi, and bus drivers wey wan give am licence, im gather information.

E know which local lite wey dem catch dey push drink, wey dem catch with dia oga o.

Dis one no be small thing to di government for Panamanian government for 1967 when union leaders dey plan May march wey government fear sey e go bring katakata.

Oga Noriega don hear sey one local union leader dey sleep wit di wife of im govnor.

So e troway di informate for di handbill wey e carry go Puerto Armuelles (wey be United Fruit Co) wey dey under United Fruits Council.

Di campaign so, e divide government leaders wey be sey government find dem far easier to control.

E be like play for inside Broadway na im Mr. Martinez come talk sey Noorega just manage di whole thing.

Im fine o.

Norierie sabi bribe, and blackmailing well, well.

But during im time for Chiriqui, Oga Noriega sef reveal imsef for di oga hand, as e dey vex.

One local lawyer wey im name na Rodrigo Miranda, wey be human right monitor, remember one wey intoxicated Noriega dey go prison for inside deir cells for 5th zone garrison headquarters for David wey dey for im office.

Mr. Noriega go order dem make dem comot dia cloth, run waka around di courtyard, dey laugh dem, dey retreat to im office. People con dey wonder sey wetin cause am?

But through dis period so far reach U.S. military level, Oga Noriega na model recruiter.

E sign up for intelligence and counterintelligence training under American police for Fort Gulick for July 1967 akordin to one copy of a 1983 wey talk sey, Oga Noriega don dey classified as secret.

E fly go Fort Bragg, N.C.E. for September dat year for psychological operation, e go return to di School of America for Panama for two months wey dem dey call military intelligence for officers.

Some American officer do like sey im be tight friend, and studious na sign of loyalty, but dem no gree.

E rose to di oga patapata of intelligence for Panama wey dem dey call G-2 for 1970 afta e don give one popula politician Torrijos di critical support wey e go take win one coup attempt against am one year ago.

Di pikin name na Gen. Torrijos and naim dey keep evritin wey dey Panama.

Oga Noriega now, one lieutenant colonel don expand im contacts wit Cubans so dat e no go call Israel, Taiwanese, and any oda intelligence service na im come dey knock.

When U.S. diplomat come complain to di CIA of Col. Noriega's moonlighting, intelligence people come dey always insist on top sey im country first come from America.

E don tay wey we carry di oga patapata for inside state department o, we carry am go call am di rent a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-... a-

Even dis early stage sef, medicine cause anoder wahala.

During di Nixon administration, di drug administration come dey para on top of G2 connection wey be sey dem dey catch drug traffickers.

One agent come draw list of five way wey we take dey deal with Col. Noriega, one of dem wey be Assassination.

John Ingersoll wey bi di DEA leader, na-im dey kontrol di donkey plan.

But e fly go Panama to come dey call am Torrijos on top di medicine medicine wey government for Panama dey give am, plus Mr. Noriega.

Mr. Ingersoll later recall, Gen. Torrijos come dey fear on top di U.S. matter sey everybody dey fear am, Oga Ingersoll talk.

For 1976 na im Mr. Noriega enter one trouser wen U.S. intelligence service come tell am sey im don dey buy two electronic talk from three sergeants wey dey work for U.S. Army 470th military intelligence group.

Di tape include cabletaples of Gen. Torrijos own phone according to American intelligence keeper.

We catch am with our cookie Jar former CIA director, Stansfield Turner.

For di first time, U.S. consider to cut Mr. Noriega from his intelligence, and deliberation intensely, Mr. Turner talk sey in di world of intelligence, if you want know information, na seedy character you dey get.

Di question na how much you dey get into seedy character so dat dem go fit extort you.

Ehn technical people wey dey dere today, dey worry o wheder Oga Noriega sell sensitive informate give di Cubans, or oders.

Oga Turner give tear rubber to cancel di U.S. contract with rent a-... colonel for di beginning of Carter administration.

U.S. dem kon see new tins wey make dem dey fear as dem dey fight war.

Prosecutors for Southern Florida indicate five Panamanian on top sey dem dey run illegally to Sandinista rebels wey wan kolobi di government of Mr. Somoza.

Dem include one of Oga Noriega closest friend, and business partner, Carlos Wittgreen.

And di investigators kpakpakpa dey close for Oga Noriega.

But dat time, for 1979, U.S. begin dey do im long time spy work wey Latin America dey do.

Oga Noriega plan to fly go Washington for one meeting with im counterpart for Pentagon.

De County, and federal authorities, when dem hear sey e wan fly pass Miami, dem come plan to arrest am on top gun matter as soon as e hit U.S. soil.

Na Friday for June.

Pentagon con do di plan o.

According to military people dat time, dem con call Oga Noriega by im American host sey police go dey wait for am.

On Monday, U.S. soldiers receive one routine, unclassified message from di military commander for Panama, due to health reasons, Lt. Col. Noriega don elect to postpone im visit to Washington.

Prosecutors for Miami, dem still send dem anoda setback.

Dem sack Oga Wittgreen wey be Oga Noriega friend and di four oda men on top technical matter.

But now, along with di reindictment of Mr. Noriega's palava, dem wan charge Oga, Noriega imsef on top accuse sey e get hand for di wayo trading of some $2 million in arms.

For January 1980, Jerome Sanford, as assistant for U.S. attorney, dem summon am go one meeting wey one Federal Bureau of Investigation agent wey dem dey send go Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms for Miami.

Panamanian dictator, Torrijos, de tell am sey de don grant Iran asylum for Panama as favor to Washington.

Dem tell Mr. Sanford Oga, Oga Noriega friend, Mr. Wittgreen sey e go dey handle sha security.

E no good make we indict am o, much less Mr. Noriega, dem tell di prosecutor.

After we don talk with Oga Sanford, U.S. attorney, Jack Eskenazi, na im waka comot o, e come out o, e come out o, e come out o, e come out o, e come out o, e come out o, e come out o, e come out o, e come out o, e come out o, e come out o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o,

I tink sey if de allow us make we dey go, den we no go get problem wey we dey now o, Mr. Sanford talk sey if dey find am guilty, we for stop am.

For August 1983, Oga Noriega take over as general and facto dictator for Panama after e don maneuver im way reach di top of only two years after dem crash for one plane wey belong to im old oga, Omar Torrijos.

E no tey, military pawa start to dey kontrol legal and illegal matter.

Reagan administration too don put Mr. Noriega's G2 back for di U.S. payroll.

Di money wey dey di U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency dey average of almost $200,000 per year from di U.S.

Even dough na U.S. intelligence, Oga Noriega no too help U.S. only.

During di Reagan years, e expand business, and intelligence wit Cubans and Sandinistas.

E allegedly enter inside di first formal business with Colombian drug boss according to Floyd Carlton wey be pilot before e work for Mr. Noriega and wey testify before U.S. grand jury for Miami wey go later convict Panama on top drug charges.

But Mr. Noriega dey sure sey di Reagan White House no go do am o, e recall sey na close friend Jose Blandon na im dey do insurance policy o, sey im dey follow di Contra rebels wey dey Nicaragua.

Oga Blandon talk sey di General allow di Contrast to set secret training centre for Panama.

Oga Noriega too don sama intelligence from im spy operation inside di Nicaraguan capital of Managua.

And at least one time, in 1985, e help set up a sabotage against one Sandinista Arsenal for Nicaragua.

Even dough sey im help for di Contra cause only limited, e still win key protectors for di Reagan administration, Sen. Patrick Leahy wey be Vermont Democrat before e do Senate Intelligence Committee, na im come play U.S. intelligence agency and U.S. government ah don play U.S. intelligence committee.

Anoda incident wey happen for 1984 suggest anoda one wey be sey Oga Noriega bin control Washington people with compromising U.S. officials.

Curtin Windsor den di oga patapata for Costa Rica recall sey dem invite am for Panama by Oga Noriega broda Luis Carlos for one weekend wen e dey inside sea dey catch fish, and na so-so talk im dey yarn for Aswara Peninsula.

Sir. Windsor don koll Everett E. Briggs, di U.S. Ambassador to Panama on top di invitation, na briggs scream, Mr. Windsor con dey recall.

E say na Oga Briggs tell am sey im dey set trap wey be sey Oga Noriega go try put am for one oda, and den record di event wit loud, and video. Oga Briggs, on vacation after e resign im position for National Security Council, nobody fit come out to give you comment.

As Mr. Noriega dey support different side for politics, na so im come dey support Contras, e come get one tin wey e wan do for Washington.

For example, im help thief for May 1984 Panamanian election wey go be di ruling party.

But just one month later, e still contribute $100,000 to one Contra leader according to documents wey dem release for Oliver North criminal trial for Washington D.C.E.

But im own political setback still dey on top am.

Dem lie sey Mr. Noriega dey order for 1985 when di beheading of Hugo Spadafora, im ogbonge party for Congress, and di first man na for outside finger of Mr. Noriega ontop drug trafficking charges.

E con later appoint Presido Nicholas Ardito Barletta, one former US bank oga wit close hand for U.S. after Mr. Barletta try to create commission to chook eye on top di murder matter.

And all di money wey dey Panama, de continue to dey grow.

Mr. Noriega just dey grow dey go o.

For 1986, e do one special arrangement wey e think sey U.S. no go gree.

As in a wrapper wey dey inside di govnor document wey e comot for di north trial, Oga Noriega comot assassinate di sandinista leadership in exchange for promise to help clean up Noriega image, and to lift di u.s. ban on military service to Panamanian defence force.

Di document go on top, e dey refer to Oliver North, e don tell Noriega senate sey di U.S. law dey against all dis kind bad tins.

Di representative come tell am sey Noriega get many asset for Nicaragua and e go fit do many essential tins just as Noriega help U.S. for di last year when e dey blow sandinista Arsenal ah.

Col. North convey di request to im superior, and to Assistant Secretary for State Elliot Abrams, who relay am to Secretary of State George Shultz.

Oga Noriega don do wetin dey im mind.

And Oga Shultz curty tell Oga Abram sey make dem tell di General sey na only im go fit repair im tyre.

Di end of di marriage don dey o.

Within weeks, di ting wey dey happen for Iranian Contra scandal take comot Oga Noriega insurance policy.

CIA Director William Casey, and Oliver North, na im don die allow anti-Nigeria political force begin dey enter politics.

Public protest against am na for June 1987 after di charges wey di former oga of staff, Diaz Herrera, don thief di 1984 election, and e don order make dem kill Messia.

Padafora and Torrijos.

Some American officials don dey ready any more to defend am.

Lawers for Miami (dis time wey e dey work virtually without impediment) prepare to show am di drug charges for February 1988.

During negotiations with American officials for May 1988 on top proposal to drop U.S. indictment in exchange for en resignation, Mr. Noriega almost ask plainly how America, wey e don dey help since many years, go fit turn against am.

Now, no side, U.S., no Mr. Noriega dey dere now.

Presido Trump don sworn to carry am go kpeshon.

Oga Noriega believe sey e no get any alternative dan to continue to dey clutch power.

E get war wey dem won fight well-well and wey fit make pesin die.

At di end, na Oga Noriega, wey be political equivalent of Frankenstein monster wey e make with good mind, but wey dey deceive foreigners?

No be small wahala Sen. Leahy dey fight.

Short term gain, people con dey willing to bear am.

Dat allowed am dey grow well, well, e say I no think sey we make am as we dey feed am, take care of am, make e grow up to be big, and strong.
