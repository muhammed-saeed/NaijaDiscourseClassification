E don dey commonplace now wey prosecutors dey bring criminal indictment in case wey be sey before some years ago, na only civil action wey dey happen for most of us.

But it is also axiomatic sey di power to create new crime, na only legislature, no be court.

From 1870, U.S.

Husbandi and Goodwin, Supreme Court don yarn many times sey judicial power to talk sey e dey against public interest, and hence criminal justice, na British law we go do am for di level of separation from power.

Na di usual theory be dat now.

Di tin wey dey happen for di criminal law before, don dey blurred.

For example, e get one common law of white colonisation wey don dey increase for di past ten years.

For example, if you dey do business, e don tay wey you dey do bad, but you never get law wey go let you do am.

For 1983, Supreme Court try to give one person wey dem dey call Dirks v.

EC decision wey find dat liability depend on wheder di tipper don break im fiduciary duty wey di corporation dey carry to get some kind personal gain, and wheder di tipper know dis one well, well.

Small, small, lower court, and prosecutor don push dis definition to its breaking point.

For 1989, Brother Robert Chestman come tell us wetin dey im mind.

Prior to a tender offer by A&P for Waldbaum Inc. 1986, di founder of di Waldbaum supermarket, call am old relative to tell am make e arrange im stock certificate for delivery.

She call her daughter carry am go bank, wey in turn, persuade her husband, Oga Loeb to do dis errand.

When di husband hear wetin e talk, e come follow im broker, Oga, Chestman, and Oga, Chestman come buy im own account, and oder clients.

Basically, Mr. Chestman na fourth level tippee.

Oga, Loeb, im tipper, e do yeye duty (and if na so, na which one?)

Oga, Loeb no find wetin go favor only imself (and if na so, how)?

Abi Oga Chestman hear rumour wey dey sell for market (wey be sey one dey sell for market?)

Di line dey kwik-kwik even for ajebo.

A second example na from di new guilty plea wey Robert Freeman, before na im be di head of di court for Goldman, for Sachs & Co, basically, Oga Freeman don invest heavily for Beatrice buy out, when anoda prominent trader, Bernard Blony, dey yarn sey di deal dey for trouble.

After dem don put order make dem sell, Oga, Martin Siegel wey be investment banker for Kidder, Peabody & Co, wey dey advise di deal, to confirm dis rumour.

Mr. Diegel ask Oga, who im source dey, when e hear sey na Bunny Lasker na im con talk sey toh your bunny get betta nose.

Di illegal tin wey dem dey call bunny nose den, na im be sey rumors don already dey ground for market.

If to sey di matter don go court, di same kweshon for di matter for di kourt for sey, ‘Una get fisical breach wey go make una gain anytin?’

Oga, Freeman see dis one so?

Finally, na di information material?

But all dese issues na subsidiary of one more central issue na, who dey and who suppose be to dey do di criminal law for here?

No be sey I talk sey Oga Chestman, or Oga Freeman, sey im kill innocent person for inside prosecutor hand.

Even di two of dem, de admit sey deir behaviour dey at risk.

But even if dem behave anyhow, reason still dey for dem to dey fear even if na to dey force dem to do wetin di law tok.

Court and legislature dey do different, different way, and each person fit do different kind of mistake.

After difact, judicial examination of an actor conduct has always been di common law method.

When na only civil liability, dis method get di undeniable strength of factual specificity, avoid overgeneralization.

Still, case by case, retrospective decision on top dis kind matter dey vulnerable to di tunnel vision wey dey on top ad hoc (and usually leazy) example.

When one court decide sey one actor conduct dey culpable, and so far di definition of insider trading to reach dis conduct, e no see di potentially huge number of oder cases wey go be sey di extension rule dey cover.

Na im make court never fit setol matter on top social matter wey concern expanding authority.

For example, to dey focus on top dis one wey be sey di deal don fall, one person no just dey reason on top di reverse side of di coin sey, ‘What if na lie?’

One security analyst call one investment banker to make sure sey rumour wey dey allegedly lie, na fake rumour.

Before now, no be only sey dem go rush go talk about dis rumour wey dey comot from di company, but di company wey dey di major stock exchange, dey encourage dem to do openly to dis kind kweshon wey securities analyst dey bring.

Today, after Oga Freeman plea, uncertainty dey, e dey unfair, e dey inefficient.

In dis light, di advantage of legislative law na im e don dey clear: Before e act, parliament go hear di views of all di people wey dey affected by di law, no be only di immediate party wey dey court, and (2) parliament go fit dey set right line for law wey dey give different different opinion wey different judge dey give.

Although legislative line fit lead to underinclusion (wey be sey e don tay wey the SEC don dey obey law to regulate how dem dey do business), legal judgement go always dey cause uncertainty because of shadow shadow, and consequences of most judicial decisions.

At least, when stake high, e go turn to where dem dey trowey dirty put, as some people no fit go near any road wey no smooth at all.

Federal mail, and wire fraud statutes provide even better illustrations of how rapidly change one Federal law of white collar crime.

For 1987, Supreme Court try for McNally v.

U.S. to stop di inexorable expansion of dis law by adopting strict construction for egotism.

But, late last year, Congress con essentially reverse dis decision by enacting onesentence statute wey talk sey dem go carry out any attempt to deprive anoder person for di intangible right of honest service, at a stroke, dis may be e go carry all fisical breach (and maybe all misrepresentation by agent or employee).

That one na one kind statute wey be sey na im be di fundamental problem: Congress don dey see am sey e go easy to pass big, big law wey di court go later interpret, na im go do di big, big distinction wey be sey na insurbordination dey.

We dey face less judicial power grab dan legislative giveaway.

Predictably, when confronted by morally stupidity, prosecutors go use such free will give dem.

But for long run, na only slazy case go lead to bad law.
