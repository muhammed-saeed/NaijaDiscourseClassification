:.START

Dis one na to correct one misunderstanding for your Oct. 3 wey be sey deat from Advanced Colon Cancer fit reduce by using two drug, for dis topic, I dey yarn sey, â€œAny patient with high risk of colon cancer go suffer well, well if e no get dis treatment.

I no talk am, and I absolutely opposed di philosophy wey di quote dey talk.

I no offer, and I no go offer routine therapy with di two, levamisol, and fivefluoracil, any of my colon cancer patients.

With dis treatment we don reduce deaths for high risk colon cancer by one third, but dis one dey reduce di two third wey dey die from cancer.

Dis one no nearly do am.

I believe sey any doctor wey dey treat cancer patients both today, and tomorrow, e go give me hope of better ting.

My statement, read verbal analysis from one printed text wey dey reach all reporters wey dey go National Cancer Institute news conference, na im be di following: New clinical trials don dey ground to improve dis result.

Dis research protocol dey offer di patient not only di best therapy wey we don establish today, but also di hope of sometin wey still dey better.

I dey feel any patient with high risk cancer dey go down if you no offer am dis opportunity.

We get very exciting prospects for di treatment of colon cancer during di years immediately.

But if we use levamisol and fivefluoricil take stop am, we no go ever see am.
