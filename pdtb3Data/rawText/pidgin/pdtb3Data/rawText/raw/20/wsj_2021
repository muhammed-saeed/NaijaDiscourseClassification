Ehn no be small government matter wey be sey na from olden days, now wey be sey de don dey different from old, new environmentalism (Journalists and oders for Saving di Planet), by David Brooks, by editorial page, Oct. 5.

Older Environmentalism mean microbe hunter, and sanitation specialist.

E start with improvements in hygiene wey affordable soap, and washable underwear during di Industrial Revolution.

Dem still follow one iron pipe wey dem dey call flush toilet follow am till di 19th century.

Medicine for di 19th century na mostly to fight sepsis, and diagnostic analysis.

Den di 20th century sey private-sector medicine, wey be sey de dey take promulgated medical therapy, dey come out.

Wetin happen to us really make us dey expect pipol more-more, sotey e dey pain us well-well.

Dem dey do most of di public health matter for local level.

E fit be sey di new environmentalism start for 1962 with di publication wey be Rachel Carson book, Silent Spring. Shortly thereafter, hysterical articles begin show o sey, advanced industrial society go produce one kind black, ogbonge, uninhabitable planet maybe by di time of di century.

Some of dem wey sabi this matter pass na Paul Ehrlich, Barry Commoner, Rene Dubois and George Wald.

When e write for di 1960s, Ms. Carson talk sey dem go fit kill human being for 20 years, and Oga Wald talk sey life for earth go end for 1985.

Brother Mr. Ehrlich talk sey e go happen like that for 1980.

Di tins wey e do, many pass am.

Dem describe many chemical products as carcinogenic, wit recommendation sey make dem no dey use am for industrial use because e dey produce malignant tumor for overdosed rats.

Before 1960 na im dey cause big ice-blok rain, greenhouse warming, ozone depreciation, all of dem na to give dem new power, and gargantuan price.

Meanwhile, di New Environmentalists do everything to stop di old environmentalists.

Local pollution palava need to use cheap energy, and capital to take solve am.

But di New Environmentalists deny private wealth creation (wey dem dey claim, dey fill natural resources), and nuclear power even though e go counter di greenhouse effect.

Dem dey push to find new landfill, and to use incineration, and even opposition to new method of research like agric engineering.

New environmentalism na emotional attack on top different different way wey we take dey live better life and bid for political power.

Make we reason our priorities na to solve pollution matter for local level as per today.

Your tory miss some key points for di conference on top di global environment, Are We Overreacting?

First of all, di vignettes wey different scientists dey bring, na general consensus among specialists wey dey different part of di world environment.

For example, di greenhouse effect and climate change, many blue-ribbon science committee, including one person from National Academy of Science, dey judge dem wey big pass 50% of the wahala wey dey happen on top di matter.

Di point na to answer question for di conference title, no be to try to create tori for di event itself.

No be sey dem dey talk sey dem go do some kind things, even if some of the things wey dey the plan na different.

Dem tell di speaker sey make e address one particular topic, no give point of view.

Each scientist independently conclude society, and government dey under reaction when it comes to substantive policy change.

Dis one dey lead to very special urgency.

If media decide to work harder on top dis complex and technical matter, nobody go fit call am non objective journalism.

Dis wahala wey wi dey face now, nor bi new tin again, but na evritin wey wi dey do, wi go tink about am.

We don literally change chemistry, and physics for our planet atmosphere.

Dis one go bring consequences for wetin we don do wey go dey very unstable for social, and economic system.

Di problem wey dey di environment dey so, na im dey make us fit entice oursef with di way we dey live our life now, sotay we no go fit esplain to dem well unless major change dey in less than 10 years.

Di consensus from scientific community be sey enough evidence dey to advise major policy change.

No o, we no dey do anyhow o.
