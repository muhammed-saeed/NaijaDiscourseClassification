Nothing make Ronald Reagan, im and im disciple dem, even di crusade to help Nicaraguan Contra rebels, or di dream of building big shield to take stop Soviet nuclear missile.

But under Oga, Reagan's preferred successor, President Bush, dat two, two national security cause dey shook for di vine.

And surprisingly, small protest wey be sey de just breath small na im de dey go on top Contras and Strategic Defense Initiative once o.

Di programme get arthritis says Rep. Henry Hyde, one conservative from Illinois.

E talk sey : “ Una dey look everywhere and una dey ask sey na who be the people wey dey lead una?

Who go carry di water? ’

E no surprise us sey Presido Bush never lead im crusade to pump up di Contrast, or SDI, though im no dey support both programmes, Mr. Bush no be serious champion for any kind matter as Mr. Reagan dey.

Wetin dey surprise be sey, no more of oga patapata for inside bush administration dey push di programme make e dey fall on top of Nationalpriority list.

E get some wey be sey na only some of dem dey wear anyhow waka, some no dey do anyhow waka, some dey worry sey war go happen for Soviet society and some dey worry about any oda matter.

But on top all of dem o, Republicans wey be sey de don champion di Contrast and SDF, dem no gree attack one Presido on top sey e no do more dan sey e dey pain.

We wan complain, we wan talk sometin about am, and we dey go as e dey worse, na im Repentant Dan Burton wey be staunch backer talk am sey but e be like sey e dey kick your papa for inside di trouser.

You hate to do am because na your father o, na im Mr. Burton talk sey no be small wahala im dey carry on top di recent coup wey dey happen for Panama, na im make am dey ready to talk more.

Of course, Presido Bush, not even Congress don comot di Contrasts, or SDI, Mr. Bush don enter a deal wit congress people to provide nonlethal aid to di Contrast until January wey go hold national election next February.

But administration don stop any attempt to win military aid for rebels.

And administration dey deal wit Congress dem even though sey dem get right to cut off even humanitarian aid next month even though sey di goment go allow am continue till February.

Most analysts say small quantity of di Contrast fit be huge fight without U.S. hand, and after February election, deir future go dey uncertain at all.

Instead of focus on top di Contrast, Mr. Bush don shift to urging members of Congress most recently, for a White House meeting to approve financing for di election campaign of political opponents of Nicaragua sandinista government.

Di administration still dey support SDI, or Star Wars, and e recently lobbie Senate to resurrect some of di funds wey e bin plan to cut on top di programme.

And just last week, Defence Secretary, Dick Cheney give strong speech wey dey drop down say e go push ahead with SDI say e go urge Presido bush make e do one defence bill wit inadequate funding for di programme.

But di mighty pitch by Oga Cheney fit no too late to prevent damage to SDI.

House don already vote for deep funding, and in di end of di programme backers go suffer small, small reduction in spending next year.

And while di defence secretary dey yarn, Presido Bush imsef never launch any high vision campaign to drum dey support as Presido Reagan do.

Administration too don gree sey no be di original vision of one impenetrable shield wey dey protect di whole U.S. but rather, na di one wey small pass.

MEMORIAL to SDF supporters, Bush administration o, e be like sey de don tactfully accept new arm control proposal from Soviet Union, wey be sey na long time ago wahala for Star Wars.

Soviets don gree to complete one treaty wey be to cut strategic weapons without restriction on space bases.

But di Soviets too dey insist sey dem go reserve di right to withdraw from di full strategic arm later on top if sey U.S. dey use SDI testing, or deployment wey be sey Soviets dey take deir anti-ballistic treatment.

E go hard down di road to persuade congress to approve money for SDC plan if lawmakers fear sey dose plan go fit scata complete treat treatin.

As a result, Frank Gaffney, wey be former military adviser, wey dey head di Centre for Security Policy, e come yarn sey administration na "promise of continued commitment to development, and deployment of di SDI programme credential."

But dis one wey be sey deir hand no dey for dem again, sey deir hand no dey for dem again because sey deir hand no dey for inside register wey be sey de don dey weak under Mikhail Gorbachev.

In fact, because communistist wan dey do global retreat now, some conservatives fit just dey happy sey deir anti-communist philosophy don dey ground now, sey de no get fire for now to dey do controversial tings o, sey di most hardworking part wey dey among us, na im dey make am difficult for us to enter inside communistia, wey be president for Hudson Institute.

Some activists dey toil to promote di profile of di two cause.

But de say de no fit make plenty headway because of sey de no get willing leaders wey go fit turn tide.

One long time champion for Congress, Republican whip for Newt Gingrich of Georgia, dey distracted by question on top im ethics, tok true.

Other champions wey dey do well like Wyoming Republican Sen, Malcolm Wallop, long time advocate, no get di clout for Bush White House wey de bin enjoy wit Presido Reagan.

On top all dis one, proponents talk sey no be sey di Contra, or no be sey di SDI cause, dem go push am well, well without sey president support am again sey, because breeze for any programme, na im di main executive go dey blow inside di sails.

All dis one dey cause respet hyde to muse as alternate way to bring more drewo.

Sey wetin I go like to see, if im go am, na for Reagan to carry am go di hustins to regenerate enthusiasm for SSDI wey be congress man.
