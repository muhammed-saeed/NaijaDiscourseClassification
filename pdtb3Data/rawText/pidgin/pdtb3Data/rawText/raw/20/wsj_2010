Boston Globe talk sey di new design wey dey for di new page get “crisper” look with new fixtures wey dey bring di paper more consistent, and easier to read.

Maybe so if you can find di place wey your favourite writer went.

Area scribes, wey no get vexnashon when dem carry local lite like Michael Petee wee, Dukakis, or New England Patriots coach, Raymond V.

Ray Berry, yesterday tear for new picture of Globe columnist wey replace old picture for di new page wey dey di new one wey dey di new one.

By dis time, Globe Managing Editor Thomas Mulvoy, e bend for wetin im soldier go do, tear di new drawing.

“E go tey before e go sey, ‘Wi nor go draw anytin wey bi like image or picture.’

Trouble dey, nobody think sey dem look am well.

Globe columnist Mike Barnicle for di second attack wen im owe im oga for many weeks, averred say di shadow of im shadow dey bad sotay e look like sey na bottle of miracle elixir wey e promise to do for our lifetime. Oga Barnicle, e still dey remind people sey e never still forgive Globe management for im waka wey dey park im car dey run follow one story.

I tink am sey di drawing wey dey between one person wey you dey call whip wey dey open im trench coat, or one man wey dey boast sey im na Charles Manson roommate for 19 years na im e beg.

Mr. Barnicle no enter di translation of colleagues wey im name na Michael Madden (appears to be pervert), Will McDonough (e dey look as if e dey drive for Abe Lincoln), or Bella English wey im small girl con dey shout hysterically every time she see newspaper.

Lynn Staley, di Globe assistant managing editor for design, na im dey yarn o sey di face be "on di low end of di likeness spectrum."

Rival Boston Herald columnist, Howie Carr, wey usually dey inside state house (hack) and nepotism), de argue sey di new draw na to hide Oga, Madden's "Rain dey grow for head", and di facial spot wey dey di face of Dan Shaughness, one Globe reporter.

But think of di money wey you, di person wey you dey read, go save on Halloween, na im Oga God Barnicle talk sey instead of you to dey buy face mask for your pikin, just cut di picture of people wey dey write wetin dey happen.
