"Uh... one time I was with my mom and dad in the village, after I was grown (I was like eight), and my grandmother came to visit us."
She wanted to take me to go and train me.
"Because at my dad's, we could only go to the farm."
"At the time, I was small and could farm really well."
"My grandmother said this farm, this farm work was no good for me."
That I should go to school first.
So I went to my grandf-... grandmother's.
I was schooled there for four years.
"After those four years, my mom said the work had become too much for her to do alone."
That I should come help her for a while.
"I was there, helping her."
I kept farming.
I farmed for almost five years.
I didn't go back to school.
I stayed there
"Ha! Even for money to buy things, you won't see any money."
"For any little thing you do, though, you will make money quick."
"Finding something to do, that was the hard part."
Until there were a lot of us.
"So my friend and I, we started to work together for people."
"Then, at the end of the year, they would come give us our money."
"We would use it to buy clothes, anything we wanted."
We used it to take care of ourselves.
"Then we did ""waye"" work again, we got the money and shared it"
All of us said we wanted to go to school.
We wanted to go back to school.
"So, then I went to school until two thousand and eight."
Then I finished primary school there.
"I told my father, well, I want to go to the city to go see how the school is."
That I was tired of school in the village.
"My father said okay, he will get money to register me anywhere I want to go to start secondary school."
I said okay.
That's what we did.
"My father said it wouldn't be until after December, around January, that he would get me registered."
"So, right then, that my uncle came from Abuja."
He came to construct a building for one of our uncles.
He then came.
When he was leaving he said I should be ready for him to take me to Abuja.
"I said ""alright."""
"""Do you want to take me to Abuja?"""
"He said ""yes."""
"I said ""okay, but uncle, I want to go to school."""
He told me not to worry.
"If he takes me, I'll go to school."
So I said okay.
The time came when we wanted to leave.
So the two of us got on the bus for Abuja.
"When I got to Abuja, I stayed there."
"At that time, I couldn't... I couldn't speak English fluently but I was getting by."
"So, then my uncle came."
I was there for like a month.
Now I could speak.
Then my uncle said we should go to school.
I then went to school to register.
It was from there that I started school.
I went to school and then came back home to stay.
I told my uncle I could not stay at home any longer.
"If I come back, if I am back from school, I should find a job to learn."
My uncle asked what my problem was and why I wanted to learn a trade.
"I said uncle, the problem is, nobody knows what the future will bring."
Maybe I can finish the junior WAEC.
I don't have any money to go back to school.
"Or look at how, uh... money is now, it doesn’t flow like before any more."
"So my uncle said ""okay."""
What did I want to learn?
I told him I wanted to learn to cut hair.
"He said okay, I should go for it."
Then I went to meet a guy I knew.
I told him I wanted to learn a job from him.
"He said okay, I should go call my uncle."
"I told him okay, before I go call my uncle, he'll tell me what to bring"
"Before I go tell my uncle, let me know what he meeds to bring."
He said okay.
"We'll get crates of soft drinks, and some cookies, and money."
"Since he knows me, we'll bring eight thousand naira."
I said okay.
I went to meet my uncle.
"So my uncle said okay, tomorrow morning, before he goes to work, I'll take him there."
So we went there and met the guy
"He told the guy that he would bring al-, everything he had listed."
"The man said okay, I can start learning today."
I then stayed there learning the trade.
Then my uncle brought everything.
The man said I'd stay with him for five years to learn the job.
"I then told him ""well, but what if I master the skills before the five years, I can go open my own shop, right?"""
He said yes but I will graduate first before I go open my own shop.
"I said ""okay, if that's it, no problem."""
So I continued working on and on and on.
Until the time came that I wanted to write the junior WAEC.
I already mastered the job and was making money.
"I then realized that in this country of ours, things were starting to become difficult."
"I then told my boss ""Well, there is this job I found."""
"""Let me go do it and they will pay me."""
"""So if they pay me, I will get the money for my graduation."""
"My boss said ""okay"", I should go."
"As long as place I was going was good, I should be careful there."
"I said ""okay."""
I was there.
I went to work.
"After I worked and the woman paid me, I started completing the junior WAEC."
"Before I could get the money, my uncle gave me some."
I went to register for senior high.
"From there I went to school until the last year, two thousand and sixteen, when I wanted to write the WAEC."
"Even sometimes, to pay tuition, I would, I wouldn't have the money to pay on time."
So they would send me home.
I didn't go to school for like a week.
I said let me go and get a manual job.
Maybe I would get something to pay my tuition so my uncle could help me with the rest.
I was working.
Until the time we wanted to write the WAEC.
I couldn't make money.
And my uncle didn't have any money either.
One of his in-laws was even sick.
"All the money he had, he used for his hospital bills."
"From there, one day, I told my uncle ""look at the WAEC, the WAEC is here."""
People had started registering.
I never registered.
So how will I take the exam?
"My uncle said well, if I didn't do it this year, I shouldn't get angry, I should go get a job and he too would try his best."
"The following year, I might be able to take the exam."
"I told my uncle ""okay, let's see what God can do."""
I was there hoping.
I had no job.
I kept looking for a job.
There was no job.
"For almost half a year, I didn't find any job."
"One day, my uncle told me he'd seen a place."
I should let him take me there to work.
I went.
"After working for a month, at the end of the month, the woman should pay me."
The woman said she didn't have the money.
I should wait a few weeks.
"I repeated ""a few weeks?"""
"She said ""yes."""
"Years had passed, and the WAEC was coming up."
"I said ""okay, no problem."""
I waited.
Until the day the woman wanted to pay me.
"She paid me and said well, I couldn't keep working."
"I said ""hey! What's the problem?"""
She said she couldn't keep owing me money.
"That even for the work I just did, paying me was difficult."
"I said ""okay, no problem!"""
That was how I went back.
This year I'm going to take the WAEC exam again.
This year is the worst.
I haven't had any work this year at all.
Even getting by is by God's grace.
Now I am managing.
"Then I said ""well, uncle, can't I take the WAEC exam this year?"""
"My uncle said ""well, he doesn't have any money."""
Taking the WAEC exam costs thirty eight thousand naira now.
"I said that before I take the WAEC, I need almost fifty thousand."
Let me register for the NECO and WAEC together.
Everything will cost a lot of money.
"I said ""okay."""
"He said ""what we will do is, at the end of the year, I will go for coaching classes."""
Let me go and take classes.
"I said ""okay."""
"There came a time, two months ago, when they were sitting for the JAMB."
"I told my uncle ""Well, the JAMB is here, can I go take it too?"""
"My uncle said well, I could go take it."
"But he asked what I wanted to study there, since I did not know what it would be like."
"I said ""well, I know a bit about computers."""
"But before they start, they will teach us how to go about it and so we went there."
My uncle said I should go ask how much registration would cost.
I went.
"They told me it is five, five, that is how they do it."
Then I went to meet my uncle and told him the price.
"My uncle said okay, I should go."
"I should come, he would go borrow the money to give me."
I came and he borrowed the money.
Then he gave it to me.
I went to register.
"After I registered, I took the JAMB exam."
"After I took it, I was biding my time."
"So then, one day, my uncle asked about the result, and if I passed, where I would want to go afterwards."
Would I go to a university or would I go...?
"I said ""well, even though I will go to university, I do not have my WAEC results yet."""
"""I can't go like that."""
"He said ""okay."""
There was no money for the WAEC.
I want to go to university.
"I said ""well, then let us see what God will do for us."""
"Especially, with the way our country is at the moment, we don't have anything anymore."
"Even people who are working for the government, they're complaining about not having any money either."
"Greetings, guys."
"So, I just want to talk uh... about uh... wife beating."
You do not understand what the women ba-...?
"The, the, way they beat, beat women."
The way that they mu-.
The way they do not even treat uh...women like human beings.
I really don’t know.
This really does happen a lot in Nigeria.
"A person will get married, he will have a woman move in, he doesn't know he never liked the woman."
Why did he marry her then?
That is what I just don’t know.
"Later, even if it's money he doesn’t have."
And you just try uh... to do som-...
"Even if it is leaving the house, you should even leave the house!"
But it is uh... anger.
"You will just be angry, you will just be beating the woman everytime."
"Sometimes, they will even just take a knife, and like stab the woman everytime."
I just don’t understand.
"Wait, is it because women can't fight or do anything"
"And even in Nigeria, I don’t even know whether they, they really look into this matter."
I just don’t understand.
I just don’t know.
"This matter, it is just, it is becoming serious, it is happening more and more every day."
I just don’t know what is happening.
"The thing, it even leads to uh... uh... human uh... uh... uh... trafficking where a person will see a woman..."
"Even the, even we notice all this human traffi-, uh... trafficking, where they uh... carry uh...women."
"They will carry them, they will export them like rice."
Are they rice?
Are they pencils to export and import?
"Even men, if they say they want to add men, it's one in ten."
"It is women who will s-, let's say they are uh... ninety nine uh...percent."
Women are one uh... percent.
Why?
"They will just be using women, beating them anyhow."
I am saying Nigeria should look into this matter.
"It is not good, it is not good."
"A lot of the time, this thing, it destroys families."
"If children, small children see this thing, it'll just increase every day."
If a small child just...
"We think that all these small children, they don't know anything."
"I'm telling you, small children, they know something, but they know more than us because, at that time, there is nothing in their brain."
They don't think about anything.
We're the ones who get all these things in our head.
"We will say ""ah! We want to get work, I want to go to work, ah! This thing that I do for work, everything I am doing for this place, I need to go to Oshodi!"""
"All these things are in our heads, but when it comes to small children, they don't have anything in their heads."
"So, anything that they see, that they hear, even if they cannot say anything, those things get wired in their brain even when they become adults."
"So, that's what is making this thing continue."
"A child who says he sees his daddy beat his mummy, if that child grows up, do you want to tell me that that child will not be... be a wife uh... uh... uh... uh... beater when he gets married?"
That's how it will be now.
"It will just continue like that, and the thing cannot stop."
I say that charity begins at home.
"Let us start this thing for, for, for our own self."
Nobody will do it for us.
It's us who will do it for ourselves.
We will do it for ourselves.
"Nigerians, I beg you."
"Let's act in a good way, don't let us spoil ourselves, but make at... at least, Nigeria better."
"When it comes to mo-, moral civilisation (if that's what I want to call it), let's just be good to each other, don't let us just be..."
"In fact, if it's our own family members, don't let us do bad to our own family members."
Thank you.
"I know that right now, they have even created..."
"It is good that they have created this uh... women empowerment uh... thing uh... for Nigerians, for Nigerians."
"And there is even one (I don't remember the exact name), which they have created for all this uh... uh... demoralisation of women, uh... demoralisation of uh... women and even children."
"So, when you see someone, if it is on your uh... uh... doorstep, if it is in your uh... uh... uh... uh... neighborhood that you see a man beating women (sometimes, they don't even care if it is outside, they will even strip a woman and beat her severely), don't just leave it saying uh... this thing is none of your business."
It is!
It's everyone's business!
"Because some people will just want to say ""please, I don't wanna interfere in this matter""."
"If that man kills that woman in that place, don't you know that God will... will... will deal with you?"
"God will deal will you, God will punish you because you were there and you did not stop it."
"If you can stop the man, stop him!"
"And if it means reporting to where he needs to be reported, take him to the police!"
Go and report him to the police!
"Because that thing is not good, it's not good."
That's why I even like foreign countries.
"In some foreign countries, they don't allow anyone to touch uh... anyone."
"If it is touching a child; if it is touching a uh... uh... uh... uh... wife, you are not su-, you don't... you cannot... you can't try it now, you can't try it, you can't do it."
"Please, when you see a wife, a wife, women, when any man beats you, go and report him to the police."
"This, go and report it!"
Report!
"Whether it is your husband, he's not supposed to do that to you."
Thank you!
That's what I wanted to tell you.
"Me, my name is Joseph Aseginmba."
I come from a family of five.
Two are girls.
Then the other three are boys.
"But later on, well, one of the girls she... she... died."
Though only one of the girls remains here.
"And I come from uh... Plateau State in Nigeria here, which is in the Middle Belt."
Uh... that's where I come from.
"And uh... in the long run, my father... my mother was the first to die, then my, my mother followed suit."
You understand?
So... and I am... then I... then I...
"After my National Diploma, I got a job at the National Open University."
"That's where you get the chance to hustle, they, they do some sign things."
"They use it for school, in fact, they use it to help other families."
That's the hustling method.
Abuja is a very good place to stay.
"But the, the cost of living of the people in Abuja now, it's, it's high."
It's not a low standard.
But there are some ghetto areas.
It's not like there are no ghettos here.
"But, yet, the ghetto area is just like the city in my... in the place where I come from."
You understand?
"So... but staying in Abuja is, is the best... is the best thing to do."
Everybody wants to be in the Federal Capital City.
You understand?
But life in Abuja is very expensive.
"Housing, transportation, food are very expensive."
And it's because of my father's death.
"The m-... my own... the... my mother's death is not painful to me because in her case, she, she, she was sick for a long time."
She co-... then she died.
"But in my father's case, he was not sick."
Nothing was wrong with him.
He just went out in the morning.
He just came back.
He was not feeling well.
We took him to the hospital.
"Before you knew it, he was dead."
So I was really surprised.
"Mstchew then I realised that anything, even what I was doing... I will just remember that this life is vain."
"If you go out and come back without coming down with an illness and nothing is wrong with you, you should really thank God for that."
"Pidgin is not a language that one can master completely now, but the little ones I know, I will say it."
Ehen.
"Myself, uh... I come from a ghetto."
"So Pidgin, at least, that's what we grew up with."
You understand?
It's something we have been into since our childhood.
"The, the Queen's English, we started learning it when we went to school."
So it's a normal thing to speak Pidgin throughout life.
"As for the current government, they are really doing their best for Nigeria."
They are doing their best on the issue of corruption.
"Definitely, what they are doing is... it will really help the masses in Nigeria, but the people who will enjoy it... it's not time yet."
It's later? the enjoyment will come later.
"Definitely, the government is doing their best."
"They should keep it up, up, just as it is."
"And all these divisions in uh... Nigeria, the issue of Biafra, mtschew, I don't like it because if you check it [you'll realise] that in the Ea-... in the East, people are not... [there's] no, no infrastructure."
"If they say they want to divide Nigeria now, where will they start?"
They don't have a place to stay.
"Everywhere, per se, is the secretariat."
There is no...
"And in that place, they place high value on landed properties as if it's gold."
"Ehen... if you take a look at the North now, most of them (for instance in this Abuja) most of them are selling water and pushing carts."
"Okay, if they split now and they go back to the North, now, who will buy their water and barrow, huh?"
Will they push their barrow there?
So let's just stay united... let's just stay together.
We will move Nigeria forward.
Mstchew I don't watch...
"At most, what will make me... I unwind by browsing."
"We browse the net, chat, I mean we get to know different things on the internet, things I didn't know until now."
I will go and research.
"Ehn, the problem is just that..."
"If I get tired, I'll go and relax with friends and come back to the house by ten o' clock."
Should I start?
"Okay, in this year twenty eighteen, man, I'm praying for God to help me."
"Help my business, help everything I do, even my de-, de-, destiny, even my father, even my dad, even my sister, even my future wife, even my girlfriend."
"Oh eh, God, dear God, help me in whatever I do."
"Help me, hm... even in Enugu where I'm living."
"Help me, even my boss, even whatever, whatever I put my hands on."
"God help me, help me, help me."
This is my... this is my prayer.
Okay.
"Okay, from now until..."
"From thi-... from this, uh... January, till after January, I want..."
"From the... from January... from January to, for some... from January to February, God, help my, help my mom."
"From February till March, help my father, from March to April, help my girlfriend, from April till December, help my boss."
"Uhuh, in this country of ours, Nigeria, I am fed up with this Nigeria."
I wanna move.
I wanna go to Malaysia.
"You see this, all the gu-... guys in Malaysia, uh... mtschew, I want to meet up with them."
These guys in Malaysia are really making some money there.
I wanna go there.
"The guys in Malaysia, I want... I want..."
I really want to be a Malaysia guy.
I wanna make money in Malaysia.
Malaysia's where I wanna be.
I'm tired of this country.
"In fact, if I... if I... if I leave this country uh... mtschew, I'm not coming back."
I'll stay there forever.
This is...
"In fact, I'll marry a white girl."
"I'd even marry a Malay girl, a Malaysian girl."
"They are... they're fi-... they, they, they’re fine you know."
"They, they're even better looking than Nigerian girls."
"Even all this hardship in our country has started affecting our, our girls."
Okay.
"So Malaysia, Malaysia re-... Malaysia remains my top option for now."
I don't have any other country apart from Malaysia.
"I want to go to Malaysia, I need Malaysia, I need Malaysia's money, I need Malaysia, everything from Malaysia, even a Malaysian car."
I'm tired of Nigeria.
Almost everything in Nigeria is bad.
I don't need Nigeria anymore.
Thank you.
"Yeah, I don't need Nigeria anymore."
Nigeria is crappy country.
A crappy country.
I'm tired of Nigeria.
Everything in Nigeria is bad.
"Noth-, nothing is good in this country where we're... nothing is good, not even the cars."
"When it comes to celebrations, we can't pu-... have any?"
"When it comes to hospitals, oh!"
"That one, we've suffered too much."
We've...
Nothing is good in Nigeria.
"Nigeria is, it's a bad country."
It's a bad country.
I'd be better off if I went... I'd be better off if I go and die in China than stay in this country now.
Yeah.
Nigeria's no good anymore.
"This time around, Nigeria's prophets are too tough!"
Uh...
"When we... when we... when we get to the New Year, yeah, Nigeria's prophets, they're way too bad."
All of them will continue to predict.
"All of them, all of them will continue to predict."
And predict.
"Afterwards, they will tell us God told them."
What is it?
It's not God who told them.
I can't see any God there.
Can God tell some...?
Can God lie?
How many gods do we have in this world?
How many prophets do we have?
This prophet will tell you this.
Another prophet will tell you that.
Ah!
This kind of prophet is too much!
This thing is... this thing is just a Nigerian prophet.
It's not God that told them.
Mtschew.
"Uh, I don't want, uh, I don't... I, I don't care for these uh... Nigerian... uh... prophets."
They are a lot of trouble.
They are just using it to make money.
Wh-... what no...
God didn't... God didn't tell them anything.
"Next year, even if there is nothing to fear, nothing to fear, they'll keep going."
There's uh... a prediction for twenty nineteen.
"Uh... twenty ninety, nineteen, a prophecy, twenty eighteen, a prophecy."
That means God only comes once a uh... once in a... in a year.
God can tell them gu-... anything once a year.
God tells this one one thing.
God tells a different one another thing.
Hm!
That means God is g-...
How many gods do we have?
Seriously.
"Uh, in this country where we, this white oho."
What uh...
"Light is, light is..."
They're giving us...
"Sometimes, they bring the... they... they bring the light up to one hour, to almost thirty minutes."
"If they bring it, it is not full voltage."
"This country is difficult to live in, the country is very difficult to live in, it is really very hard."
"My friend, to tell you the truth, this country is not working."
This is a terrible country.
We need another country.
"If I go-... if... if it is possible, we should give Nigeria a new name."
We should turn Nigeria into America.
It would be better.
"In fact, we should change Nigeria, Nigeria into Biafra."
Biafra is the best country now.
"Nigeria is, Nigeria is past its prime."
Nigeria's not even a country anymore.
We need another country.
"Yeah, we need another country, right?"
"In f-... in fact, we need to change Nigeria into America."
It would be better that way.
"If you change America to... if you change Nigeria to America, I'm praying fo-... I'm praying for America, American gifts to come to Nigeria."
American gifts will come to Nigeria so that we...
We should try to make our country a good one.
Okay.
Good afternoon.
My name is Joke Babatunde.
I'm from Ondo State.
I live in Ibadan.
I want...
I've lived in so many places in Nigeria.
I've spent a long time living in the North.
I've lived in so many places.
I wanna teach you a recipe I learned from my friend.
It's eaten mostly by the Igbo people.
The name of the dish is ofe nsala.
"In the Igbo land, that means bitter leaf."
"The ingredients they use for cooking it are bitter leaf, palm oil... palm oil, pepper, salt... pepper, salt, meat, dried fish, stock fish, tripe (the thing that's peeled from a cow, which was inside a cow and was peeled off), ponmo [cow skin], ogiri [a flavoring made of fermented oil seeds] and Maggi [cubes]."
"The dish, you'll first of all wash the bitter leaf... the bitter leaf very well."
"You'll wash it till the bitter taste goes away, so it won't be bitter in the dish."
"Then again, we need something else."
We need uh... ede.
They call it ede in Igbo.
And it's uh... cocoyam.
So first I'll cook the cocoyam.
"Once I've cooked the cocoyam, then I'll..."
"When the cocoyam is ready, I'll wash my mortar."
"Then, I'll pound the cocoyam."
"If I pound the cocoyam... they add cocoyam to bitter leaf because they want it to be thick, so it won't be watery."
"So if I wash my bitter leaf... when I've finished washing my bitter leaf, I'll put, put water on fire, grind my pepper, and put it in."
"Then I'll put in my tripe, my meat, and my dried fish."
I'll add my stock fish.
"Once I've put everything into the pot, it will be boiling, I'll leave it so the pepper will really get into the meat."
Then I'll leave it to boil really well.
"When it's boiled very well, I add my Maggi, add my ogiri, add everything, add the salt so it will taste good."
"So if I notice that all the ingredients are done, the pepper has gotten into the meat, and the tripe, and the cow skin, everything... then, I put in the bitter leaf."
"So when I've put in the bitter leaf, then I'll add my palm oil into it."
"So when I've added my palm oil, everything will boil."
Then I will leave it.
"When I realise it's done, it has started entering... then I will put in my uh... then I will put in my, my ede."
"That's my cocoyam, which I pounded."
I will put it on the side.
"So once it is done, within five minutes, when I notice that it is well done, I will take it off the fire."
"And you can eat this kind of sauce I'm talking about with pounded yam, you can eat it with fufu, you can eat it with uh... even your semovita."
But the dish... the dish is very tasty.
"So this is the type of dish I know, and I want to teach you."
I want to talk about another dish which I know of.
"That dish, it's the Warri people... and uh... Warri people, and uh... Warri people, and uh... ban-... uh... the Bayelsa people who eat it very well."
All these people who are in the Niger Delta are the ones who eat this dish.
The name of the dish is banga
And the ingredient they cook banga with is this palm kernel... palm fruit... palm fruit which comes from pa-... uh... palm tree.
"So we will take fully ripe palm tree fruits, we will take them... take them and peel them."
"Then I will boil my, my palm fruits."
Then the ingred-... another ingredient which I need is Banga ingredient.
You will just go to the market.
You will ask for Banga ingredients.
"Banga ingredients, you will get all those ingredients, they'll have pounded it for you, you'll have mixed it together."
Then I need pepper.
Then I don't need palm oil again.
"I need salt, and I need Maggi."
"Because once all those things are already in the dish, everything has..."
You don't need to add palm oil because the palm fruits will let out palm oil.
So if I cook the palm oil... then I will cook the palm fruits.
"So once the palm fruits are well cooked, I'll boil it."
I'll boil it.
"When I finish boiling it, I will pound it."
"So once it is pounded, I will pour it into a mortar uh... this thing, wash it."
"Then I'll wash it very well with my hand, take out all the palm oil in it."
"So when I've taken out all the palm oil in it, then I'll set the palm oil on fire."
"As I set the palm oil on fire, I will add the pepper I planned to add... fresh pepper."
I'll pound it.
"Or I can put it into it, I'll put in the Banga ingredients so that it will... everything will boil together."
"So when I've poured it in, I'll add the Banga ingredients so it will... everything will boil together."
"So as all the ingredients boil, I'll..."
"Later, once it's boiled very well, when I realise that it is becoming thick and the oil has started coming up, that means that it's done, and I will add my meat."
"I'll add my meat, add my fish, add my stock fish, add my crayfish, add all ingredients into it."
"So once I've added all these things, and everything in the dish has boiled, that means the dish is ready."
"So once the dish is ready, we eat it with starch."
"We'll prepare our starch, we'll eat the Banga with starch."
We can eat our Banga with uh...
"We can eat it with Akpu, we can eat it with rice."
"If we don't have tomatoes, at times, we eat Banga with Rice."
So that's the other kind of dish I know.
"My people, good evening!"
Uh... my name is Kabiru Sule.
I come from Kastina State.
My mother is an Edo w-... is an Edo woman and my father is a Kastina man.
Uh... I am thirty three years old.
I was born in nineteen eighty four.
"Uh... I want to tell you a story on, on how our establishment was kick started."
The thing started like uh... ten years ago.
Uh... ninety... two thousand and seven.
Which means my mother likes to work out so much.
"When she was young, before she even gave birth to us, she was an athlete."
"So, since she... since she's retired now and has given birth to us all, now she's set up the gym."
"Gradually, that is how we started."
"My people, for your..."
We started with four boys' quarters in our house.
"Which means that if it rained, you would see the water get everywhere."
"That's how my brother and I, we were still little kids, (at that time, we were still in primary school) we would carry buckets of water with my mother."
We would be carrying... we would be packing it.
"We would pack the water, climb the stairs and throw it away, climb the stairs and throw it away."
"We would pack the water, and carry it."
The same thing.
We would just rinse and repeat the proccess.
"So, as God blessed us, we started working hard. Then we started moving on."
"Before we knew it, we found a place we could rent."
But I'm in Kaduna now.
"Now we're in Kaduna, in the North."
"And in our stadium, there are places which they, which they are giving out, which they are renting out to people."
"So, if you want to get... if you have one package that you want to run (maybe sports; maybe it's a dance studio you want to run), you will pay the... you will pay the Kaduna government."
The Kaduna government will give you the place for maybe five or ten years.
"So, that's how we sat down, then we opened it, and then we talked to a lawyer."
"So, the lawyer now, as we were opening it, we... he asked us what name we would want to give it."
What name do we want to give the business?
My mother said that...
"Because at that point, it wasn't like my mother didn't love me."
"Uhuh, my people, my mother loves me a lot but her favorite is my brother, Muhammed."
"So, as they asked her, then the lawyer..."
"When the lawyer asked my mother what she wanted to call gym, she said, ""Muhammed Gymnasium is what we want to name it."""
Momo's Gym.
"Me, a grown-up, I didn't even have a problem with it like ""ah, why didn't they name it after me?"""
Give it another name!
"But at that point, me, I just knew that we were starting a business and we would not be packing..."
"We would not be using buckets, water buckets to remove water from our gym any more."
"So, before we knew it, the lawyer said well, the place, the stadium where we were is called Murtala Muhammed, Murtala Muhammed uh... Stadium."
"So, the lawyer said well, if we put my brother's name there, then it w-... it will be like this Murtala Muhammed owns the place."
He asked how many children she had.
So my mother told the lawyer she had two sons.
What is the other son's name?
Kabiru.
"At the time, I didn't know whether the guy was just fooling my mother."
"He told her, ""well, Kabiru. People don't really use Kabiru that way, for business."""
"Use Kabiru for business, for business."
"So, that's how the story goes."
How they started calling the place Kabiru Gymnasium.
It's not like it's really a fantastic thing.
"Because people, I have heard people say..."
"That's how it is, my, my people, you should hear the story."
"I was in the gym one day, I was working."
I know I have gone off course from what I was... wanted to tell you.
"It's history but, I just do, want to tell you..."
It's one very good example now.
There was a day I was working hard in the gym.
"The clients that were there, who come to work out with us, they didn't know that me, I was, I was the owner's son."
"And me, I don't like to show off anywhere I go."
"I like to be humble, be quiet, without telling people that..."
"So that way, you will, you will know who is who."
"As I sat down, this one client was trying to get to know me."
Then he started telling me some funny gossip.
I just looked at the guy.
"The gossip is that, he said, ahah!"
"He heard that the woman who owns this place (he didn't know she was my mother), he said that the woman who owns this place, that she only has one child."
Ahah!
"I said, ahah, Simbo what's this guy saying?"
She has only one child?
"And she doesn't have a husband, and it's her boyfriend..."
She is... she is sleeping with all these young men.
And he's the one giving it to her.
"My people, do you see this kind of problem?"
I don't know...
Why rumours?
Why do we really like spreading rumours?
You don't have the facts.
You don't know anything.
"Now, I called this guy later on."
"The next day, I let him say all he had to say."
We laughed all through.
"Then the next day, I called him aside."
"I said, come let me..."
"Ah, come on boss, come, let's talk, let's talk."
"I then pulled him to one side and told him ""look, that story of yours you heard, that you... that you were telling me yesterday... that story you told me yesterday, it did not please me."""
"""Because this gym, is my mother's gym."""
"""First and foremost, she has children."""
"""She doesn’t have just one child."""
"""She has several children."""
"""I am her last child."""
"""And me, talking to you, I am older than you by two or three years."""
"""We have four more..."""
"""I have four siblings."""
"""Some of them are married with children."""
"""So... and the fact that... you were saying that she is chasing after young men, my mother is happily married."""
"""My father is alive."""
"So, that's how one thing led to another and I then I became good friends with this client."
"And uh... as God blessed us even more, we moved from Murtala Square."
"God blessed us, then we bought our land and we built our structure on it."
"Even today, this client still comes in, still comes to this gym and, he has become, like a part of our family now."
"Alright, if you're listening to me, this is my own little story of how my first day of... at uh... school, Kaduna State University basically went."
"So a long time ago, I was hearing that the university is a big place where you come to, you know, and meet people, as in..."
My mindset towards these things is that you...
"When you get into the university, you get to meet the big shots, different kinds of people, but guys, the kind of picture I saw over there, guys... I got tired of the part time program, I swear to God."
"So when I came in as a freshman, the usual practice is that in college, students don't gather together on the assembly ground."
"So I met a guy, by chance."
I started enjoying hanging out with the guy.
"Man, what's up?"
Where's the assembly ground?
This guy really laughed at me.
Mstchew.
"Man, it was not easy that day."
I started thinking that I should just like... call it quits.
I should just go back to my dad's.
"But if the worst happens, I have to move on."
That's life.
"So on that note, I pushed on, asking one or two questions, and I met some kinds of people."
"In fact, the way they looked at me, you know the way I dress, thinking that becoming a big boy... a new student, coming in as a freshman (you know), wanting to get uh... a hold on the university life."
So we came to a point where we finished registrations.
"After a few weeks, we were asked to start classes."
"I was thinking that it's that kind of secondary school thing where we will be... we'll be talking, you know."
Aha!
I was fed up.
Then I was complaining to one of my friends.
"I said, ""guys, is this how things work in the university?"""
"""What kind of uniforms do we wear?"""
"""Is it shorts or pants; long sleeve shirts or what?"""
"You know, based on my secondary school experience."
But the whole college thing was like a totally different experience.
"So when lectures started, as usual, there were lots of girls and guys."
"Everyone was giggling, moving around, you know."
So had the very first lecture.
I won't forget it.
Math 101.
"Guys, it was not easy to solve some kinds of math after several years, but usually as a Kaduna guy there's no messing around."
"It's a win-win situation, at most."
No loss.
We got a draw.
"When the lecture was over, we got going."
That was when I got to know what they call the school market.
"Man, you don't need to try the kind of things there!"
"Check out the restaurants, check out the fries!"
"There are different kinds of things there, you know."
Which will drain your pocket.
But those side attractions didn't really grab me.
"But guys, when I saw the kind of ladies that were there, guys, I was overwhelmed."
Mstchew!
Then I started thinking.
Is it for school I came here or is it for the birds?
"But when you get to a level like that, a guy's gotta... you know, a guy's gotta show off."
"So as things unfold, I came in contact with a lady."
Her name is Deborah.
We got to the point where we were enjoying being together.
So this lady and I started a one on one relationship.
"And luckily enough, the babe is a freshman like myself."
She also lacks experience.
She and I are the same blind horses that like to run in the same dark uh... this thing.
So we went into a restaurant.
"As a sharp guy, it occurred to me that I'll be the one to pay for her meal."
"In other words, it means man, I'm stuck!"
I sized up the situation at hand.
"Guys, they call it silva in Hausa."
That calls for fifty naira!
That means you're able to afford it!
So this babe started ordering some things which are beyond my means.
"But as a normal guy, if the worst happens, when you wake up in the morning, in this kind of uh... northern setting, you can't go without getting into small problems, and small problems like fifty bucks."
"At worst, it means you are done showing off that morning."
"At least, you get organised so that you feel OK for the whole day until maybe later something will come up like that."
So this babe just started placing her orders.
"I saw fried rice and pshew, the thing came out."
"She called for chicken, the thing came out."
"She called for soft drinks, the thing came out."
A'Ah!
So she got tired
"Myself, I'm not placing orders for anything."
She didn't know that I don't like...
"Instantly, she worked out that all these things will be on me."
"So I was trying to blend in, blend in, blend in, blend in."
"Luckily enough, when I was ready to leave in a hurry, I saw one of my boys, because that... the guy is..."
"During registration, that's where we got to know each other."
"So in the restaurant, the other guy was bringing the bill for me at last."
"When the bill was placed on my table, my eyes... my eyes lit up just like someone who just saw a ghost or something like that."
"I said, ""what is this?"""
"I was pissed off, eh."
"I just calmed down, relaxed... I just handed the bill to the girl and told her I would be back."
"Those guys, they need my attention."
So little did I know that the babe herself was street wise.
"She wanted for me to like drop my phone or something like that so if I go, I won't get out of the... I won't get out of paying, something like that."
"So there and then, I finally came back."
"Mtschew, since I felt like maybe this thing... she also, as she was placing orders for those big, big things, she was hoping that based on the way I dressed... you know the way I like to combine things and put everything on the right way..."
He's a big boy and all that.
Little did she know I had no money on me.
I only had fifty naira on me.
So that's where this babe and I talked.
So that's how we washed plates for the entire day.
"Uh... man, college life isn't easy, man."
"So from then on, I started picking up experience that taught me that in this life, even if the worst thing happens, just be yourself."
"At all... come out straight and tell them, ""look what the matter is at hand!"""
"It's either you're lucky or not; whatever the outcome, it will be clear to you."
That's how it is.
Classes went on.
"That's how we've been learning day by day... day by day... day by day, up until now."
"There was one lady, she just went into the shop."
Then she said she wanted to do facials.
"I now told her ""okay ma'am, you need to steam your face."""
"She said ""ah! what do you mean steaming?"""
"It's where we use a bath and get into it, put her face inside, uh... put her face inside."
It's a shame for that woman!
Where is she from?
I don't... I don't know.
Which village is she from please?
I don't know where she came from.
Mstchew!
Then I took her to the spare room.
"Then, I explain to her ""see how the machine is, it will steam your face."""
"She said, ""ah! Why?"""
"She hasn't seen steaming, uh... the way they do facials on television?"
She hasn't seen it.
It's a shame.
So I showed her that this is how smoke will be coming out.
"She said ""ah, you! Do you want to burn my face?"""
"I said, ""ma'am, no. It's just..."""
It's an extractor.
You didn't tell her it was an extractor?
"Haha, I told her... I told her the thing was an extractor."
It's a shame.
Which level is she now?
Now I explained to her.
Now she said let...
"Then I told her to calm down because the smoke is just steaming, the thing will just steam her face."
It's to remove all that dirt on her face now.
"Yes now, it..."
It's a shame.
Mstchew.
"Then I explained, explained, explained."
I used the best English I could.
Must she even do the facial now?
Is it to show off?
It's pride for her husband now.
It's a shame.
"So her husband will see that her face is bright, that kind of thing."
Her husband will leave all those small small girls he follows right?
That is what we do and do it.
"Then I explained everything I could, I used my best English every which way."
"Turned it, turned it, turned it."
Hey!
"At last, she agreed."
Let me give you the gist about what happened with me today.
What happened?
"The day I was doing nails, one girl came from the village."
She was pretending to be a city girl.
Sit down and let me do your nails for you!
These girls were snubbing me now.
Aha!
"I now told her, ""lady, which style do you want to do now?"""
Then she showed me this one type of manicure on Instagram she wanted to do.
Do you know who did the nails?
Who did them?
Tonto Dike.
Hee!
"She said she liked the nails, she was into that long one."
"Then I told her, ""lady..."""
A very long one!
Then she was looking at me like I don't know nails.
"Then I told her, ""lady, I know hairdressing, I know this work. I wasn't hired to do this work today."""
"So, when I told her that, she said okay, I should do the manicure for her."
Now she was bargaining.
"A manicure that we do for two thousand, she said she was going to pay eight hundred for."
I said oh yeah?
Oh yeah?
Where are you from now?
"Lady, we don't do that kind of manicure in this shop."
Don't you know that our shop is a standard one?
Uhuh!
"Then she said that she doesn't have enough money, this is what she has."
"Then I said, ""okay, since you don't have the money, go and see my management, because I don't have the right to reduce the price for you."""
Aha!
That was how we talked.
We went on and on talking.
Until the lady went to meet the management.
Then they reduced the price for her.
She tried.
"When they finished the hair, she liked it."
Is that so?
Now she was li-... behaving as if she were a big celebrity.
"She was bringing her nails here, I saw her shouting hallelujah."
"She was... she was doing selfies, Skyping, everything, everything."
That girl... that lady was no good at all.
That's how it all came to an end.
Hm.
"So as it is now, the manager knew."
"I also told her, ""okay, you don't have enought money, do the one you can afford, do the one that you can afford."""
"Then she said no, she's not doing that; the one she wants is the one she needs to do."
Then management told her we don't do manicures for eight hundred in this shop.
That was how she agreed to pay two thousand naira.
Hm!
"Even the two thousand as well, she said she didn't have enough money and she'd come back and pay the balance."
You can imagine.
That was how she sat down... sat down to finish the nails.
Aha!
"When I finished the nails, I was wondering where the girl came from."
"So I asked her, ""sister, excuse me, where are you from?"""
She said she was from Ibadan.
"I said ""aha! It's a shame! It's a shame!"""
Haha.
She said...
"I said ""which part of Ibadan?"""
Ibadan!
She said ah.
She said it's a kind of...
"Challenge, all those uh... Molete people."
"She, she said a kind of... a kind of name that I just don't..."
I just didn't...
Or is it Iwo road?
"All, all those people are bush people."
You should see the kind of fake nails she was wearing.
Haha!
She has bleached [her skin] completely.
"Hey, I can imagine."
Her hands were bony!
She was like uh... coke and fanta.
Jesus!
"No, it was like burnt plantain."
"You know like burnt plantain, that's what her hand is like."
Hmhm!
"Oh babe, that's why I said look at this girl!"
Haha!
I wanted to take a picture of her nails.
"That was how she told me that ah, I should not take a picture of her nails."
"She said if I shoot her nails, her knuckles will be showing."
"I now said ""babe, I'm taking a picture of the nails because if I don't, my customers that are coming won't see my work."""
That was how she...
"I told her not to worry because my phone, the kind of camera I have on my phone, the camera will clear all the knuckles, all the all the defects that she has on her hand."
All the defects on the nails.
So she agreed.
"I finished and she posted it on Instagram, Facebook, Whatsapp, everywhere."
Just look at the nails!
She was just feeling proud that day.
"Babe, it's no small thing."
So her friend said she liked the nails.
Hm!
Then she came to do it.
"Her, she didn't have any money, so I should also do the manicure for eight hundreed naira for that one, that day."
Eight hundred?
She can't agree to... mstchew!
mstchew!
Please!
A manicure that we do for one thousand five hundred I did for her eight hundred!
"Just to maintain a relationship with the customers, mstchew."
Hm!
"Man, that's how the matter is."
It's a shame!
"So, as it is now, the thing has..."
Management told her... told me that she had come before!
"So, that was how she kept bargaining."
"In fact, the day she came to fix her hair, that was how she paid."
Hm!
"She can haggle, she is the best haggler in Africa!"
As if!
Paying five hundred naira for a haircut!
Can you imagine?
"They say that in Lagos, that under a bridge, they do hairdressing for five hundred."
Aha!
Can you imagine?
What kind of girls are those?
They are Jews.
Ah!
"You know that those Jew girls, they are the ones who pretend they are Jews."
Jews?
"They'll pretend they're city girls so that you know, when they enter a big place like this, they'll know that they're babes."
They won't know that nothing can fix them.
Nothing can fix them.
One naira won't fix their butts like this!
"Mstchew, hm!"
My name is Bukola Ayaniyi.
I'm an authority in soap making.
"I make soap because I don't wanna steal, and I don't wanna be a liability to my husband."
"I'm just making the soap, I'm not the one who invented the soap making process."
"A long time ago, I had a shop where I sold basic products."
"But later on, things went bad."
"And myself, I can't just sit idle."
That's why one of my friends whose name is Mama Funmi (she is my best friend)... so she told me that her brother was taught how to make soap in their church.
"So since he was taught about it, he gave me the manual to read."
"When I finished reading it, I went to buy the ingredients."
So the ingredients for making soap starts with sulphuric acid.
The second one is Texapon.
The third one is s-... uh... caustic soda.
The fourth one is ST-... STPP.
"Soda ash, nitrosol, perfume, liquid gel, or foam booster, or formalin, with colour, and perfume."
That was how I started mixing soap.
"And I thank God that even though I haven't had as much business I wanted, at least I'm putting some bread on the table for my children."
And I don't...
That my clothes won't get dirty and the whole house won't be smelling.
I wash as I like.
My children wash too.
We're clean.
"Even my scent, my scent is fantastic because I add an exotic perfume to it."
The perfumes I put into it range from Ambi Pur.
"I put in lemon fruit, I put in uh... flavor, and some other perfumes."
"This means if anyone opens up my soap and sniffs it, they will ti-... they will know it's a good one."
"And my soap doesn't ruin clothes, it doesn't wash the color off clothes, it makes clothes better."
You can wash ankara and jeans with it.
You can wash any kind of clothing with my soap.
And I make it in different colors.
"I make it in lemon, pink, blue, and green, so that it will entice my customers."
"Or if they see it... ah, what color is this one?"
Sometimes I even use orange.
That's it!
So soap making is a good business!
Any woman who doesn't want her husband to mistreat her all around the house should find herself a bit of work... she should do something.
It's not good to be idle.
That's it!
"First of all, if I want to do like fifty liters, I will buy two liters of sulfuric acid."
"And the two liters go for one thousand, eight hundred naira."
A liter is nine hundred.
I will buy Texapon for six hundred naira.
"When I have bought all those things, I will..."
"First of all, I will mix sulfuric acid with Texapon."
"I will stir the mixture very well, so that everything will dissolve."
Because sulfuric acid is a very strong acid.
"So when I have stirred it very well, in order to dissolve it..."
"Because for fifty liters of soap, I will use ten spoons of caustic soda."
I will soak it in three liters of water.
"So when it has dissolved completely, I will pour it in."
"When I have poured it in with, with the stuff I've mixed earlier (that sulfuric acid, and Texapon), I will pour the caustic soda into it."
I will stir it very well.
"In fact, as you are stirring it, you will notice smoke coming off of it because the mixture is really hot."
"So afterwards, I will also mix in my soda ash."
I will pour it into three liters of water.
I will mix that too.
"When it has dissolved completely, I will pour it in."
I'll stir it very well.
"After that sulfuric... after uh... the soda ash, I will add the STP-... STPP."
I will put that into three liters of water because I don't like my soap to be watery.
"So when I've done all that... all those things, then I'll add three liters of water at intervals till it gets to the uh... perfume."
"When I've mixed everything in that order, if the water doesn't get to the measurement I wanted, I can add more water to it because if the soap is really thick, people will buy it."
"If it's too watery, it won't lather very well."
So that's how I do mine.
And I thank God for my life because I am not a liability to my husband.
People are buying it!
"Even this sister of mine, she uses my soap to wash clothes."
All the people in my compound buy soap from me.
They are buying it.
"Even the people on the street, they buy it because they know that my soap okay."
I can bring out one for you to smell.
The thing is really great.
"You can use it to wash plates; you can use it to wash clothes, you can use it to wash your toilet, mop your kitchen."
"Anywhere, anywhere; you can use it for anything, anything."
Nothing wrong with it.
No problems at all.
"So, I am alright."
Okay.
"Good, it's good."
Let me talk as a m-... about my life as a mother now as uh... motherhood.
I just gave birth uh... like seven months ago.
"Kai, when I was pregnant, it was not easy at all."
"Pregnant woman go through some tough times, man!"
"If I don't throw up today, if I don't get dizzy..."
"Mtschew, it was not easy at all, at all, man!"
"At that time uh... ah that was how, any..."
I couldn't do anything.
My husband felt really bad for me.
He was the one helping me out with some things.
"Man, all our mothers work really hard."
They are really working hard.
"But ever since I gave birth... immediately after I gave birth, look at me feeling so great."
"Everything's f-... uh, it's like I was never pregnant."
Everything's great now.
"All the headache, everything, everything, all the sickness just stopped, okay?"
"I said, ""uh, is this how it is?"""
"So now that we had the kid, the drama started."
"Yes now, okay you had a kid."
"The baby, as I f-... gave birth to her, for f- two days, I did not see the baby."
Because it came early.
The baby came earlier than expected.
So they kept her for... almost a week.
"When I finally saw the baby, see, the tiny thing looked small."
Then I started breastfeeding.
"Ah, waking up in the night is another job."
Another big job indeed.
"I was just waking at night, man."
"Sometimes... my mother was alive at the time, she would help me carry her a little."
"My husband would also carry her a while, until, until..."
Because I was only feeding her with breastmilk.
I didn't give her any...
I didn't give her any baby formula.
"So little by little, by the third month, she was waking up less at night."
I was still...
"I was still just giving her food, breastmilk."
I wasn't giving her any formula.
"When she was six months old, ehen."
"When we got to the sixth month, she stopped taking breastmilk."
"One day, I tested her by giving her baby food."
She took it.
I said ah.
Okay!
"So after some time, she started taking breastmilk again."
"So she was eating, sleeping and everything."
"That was how we went on, going bit by bit."
"But even up until now, she still wakes up in the middle of the night, she still wakes up."
But her hair has grown.
She's a girl.
"So I have started plaiting her hair little by little, little by little, and I'm buying clothes."
We take pictures.
"The girl, she likes to play with phones."
"Phones, laptops, television, all those things attract her."
I don't know if she wants to do... if she wants to go into the entertainment industry or something.
I don't know.
"We never know, but..."
"Well, she has not started talking, but we play, we laugh."
We are just...
We are just fine.
"We are just fine, enjoying."
"After my mom stayed with me for one month, she left."
"Me and my husband started doing it little by little, little by little, together."
"In fact, I've started working now."
So I have started taking her to daycare.
"So at least, sometimes, me too... I'll say I am going on, on break."
"When she goes to daycare, I'll be able to work."
I come back to the house in the afternoon.
"In the evening, we continue as usual."
"Me, I work for the local government."
I'm a civil servant.
"Uh... so there in the local government, if I..."
"But the good thing is that since I gave birth, the government has a procedure."
"I gave birth, I got uh..."
I was on maternity leave for three months.
I was away for three months.
"When I came back, three months... for those three months now, immediately I resumed, if others finish by four o' clock, they let me finish by two o' clock."
"So I finish on time, go get my child, and head home."
So this arrangement of two o' clock will go f-... will go on for six months.
"After six months, I will start working again."
So that government procedure is good.
My child will be almost a year old before I start working fully.
"So she will be very strong, like that."
Even those three months they gave us...
But we're still praying that they extend this uh... leave as uh... the doctors... the hospitals say we should breastfeed exclusively for six months.
"So if they can extend this uh... leave to a period of six months, it will be better because even that time... well, God has helped me."
There's a daycare next to my office.
I take my kids there.
"So while I'm here at work, I'll go feed her, go fin-... so that I will be able to do this uh, six months ehn.. six months full t-... uh mtschew, exclusively like they recommend."
But some people won't be able to do it.
"They won't be able to do it, due to their work."
"It... those who work with private organisations, are the ones I pity the most."
But ev-...
"Some people... even some government workers, cannot do it if there's no daycare in the office."
My saving grace is the fact that there's a daycare in my office.
"If I hadn't had a daycare in my office, it wouldn't have been easy."
"But that's what helped me, really, so I've been able to do it."
The child has grown now.
"Now, she eats."
So everything is alright.
"Ehn... now in the office, as I am, it is..."
What I do is kind of like documentation work.
Ehn.
"When the ones who go out on assignment come back, I will ev..."
"Or maybe... let's say I'm in charge of the staff, ehen what the staff does... people who go for training, who come back."
It's administrative work.
I colllect documents.
People are...
"Ah when they write application letters, they forward them to me before I take them to my boss who will then pass them to..."
Everything.
Even if people want to see...
"If people want to do... maybe... like collaboration (sometimes, all these NYSC [National Youth Service Corps] students, they come, wanting to do some work for our Local Government now), they will write their application letters."
I will be the one to process it.
I will be the one to forward it... to go and give it to my boss.
Then the boss will check it before...
"Even when the boss wants to reply, I will still be the one to still..."
"He will still channel the thing through me, then I will give the person the reply."
"Whether he gets a favourable letter or whether the thing... the deal will not work out, I'll still be the one to pass... to tell them."
"Even during promotion exercises and all these things, I am still the one who hands over the letters to the staff members."
This is what they've done.
I started working at uh... the University of Ibadan here.
"I'm an electrician, which they call onise ina."
I'm working there.
I've served...
I almost uh...
"At least, I'm up to uh... thirty five, or thirty four years in service now."
"The work I'm doing, I like it even though it's a dangerous job, it's the li-... work."
But I still like it because I'm good at it.
So I've been doing the work very well.
No problem.
"Uh... everything we're doing here (we lay cables, we do wiring, we wire homes), when the university gets electricity, we're the ones who do it."
"We do m-... we mount uh... tre-... transformer, we mount RI-... RMU."
"Lots, lots of things, that's what we are uh... using."
"We lay cables, but when we want to lay cables (that big one, the cable, if you carry it, it's a big one), we will lay it in a gutter which they dig for us."
"After that, we will install lights."
The lights make everyone cheer.
Because they know we've finished.
But it's dangerous work for a novice!
"But a person who's sure he's mastered it, he'll concentrate on what he's doing."
"By then, even though the university doesn't pay us that much for the work we're doing, we know that we're still working."
We're still doing it.
And uh... there are a lot of people with us here.
"We have uh... cable dressing, cable jointer section, we have overhead, we have uh... streetlights, we have the people doing wiring for houses."
But ours is cable jointers.
"We are the ones who bring RMU, we are the ones who mount uh... transformers in the university."
"Every high, high tension that we do, it's our section that's doing it."
We're the ones doing everything.
"Apart from that, we can do house wiring."
"But in our own section here, it's only the laying of cables, connection of transformers, connection of uh... RMU."
That’s all we're doing in our own section here.
"In this section, at least, we have three sections... two... or two."
Uh... there is rewinding.
Oh uh...
We should...
"We have ones who are re-... repairing transformers, we ones who connect transformers."
"But in our section here, I am the station head, I am the overall boss in this section, who runs this place."
We're the ones who mount all these places.
We have...
"If an... if they bring a form saying that there... it... see, there is a pro-... problem there, he will bring the form, we will fill it out, we will pass it on to our overall boss who will go and do the wor-... send us to s-... to go out, to uh... go and do the work."
That's how we do it here.
"For any other problem that comes up, first of all you'll fill out papers stating that there's a problem in this section, they want them... these people to come and do the repairs, before we can go."
It's because the boss has given instructions that we should not pass... go beyond his... our boundaries.
We're the ones doing all these things.
"Uh... those who are under me, we're at least... we are... we're up to ten, or fifteen."
"We have uh... ones who do nights, afternoons, and mornings."
That is how we do... divided them up to do the work.
"Those s-... the people who are on night shift now, they were here early in the morning."
They're here with us.
"Some people, they are regular."
"Regular, is what this..."
That's how we do it here.
We come everyday.
No shifting for that group of people.
"The ones on morning shift, they'll come in the morning."
"When it's two o'clock, they'll leave work."
They go back to their place to s-... sleep.
But the ones on the afternoon shift will come back by two.
They will close by nine.
"After nine, the ones who do... are on the night shift, they will take over for them from... to, to the other day, the second day... morning, because before the morning, people will come to take over for them."
That is how we do our work here.
No.
We don’t collect money!
"We only collect our salary here which yeah, the Federal Government gives us."
"If we go to work in a house, for instance in your house, we will not collect payment from you."
Because it is our pol-... nai-... du-... call... duty to do the work for you.
"He doesn’t collect money, he doesn’t collect money."
"The only thing we collect... we say if you say we... uh... the work which we did for you, that, it, it pleases you, you will say, ""here, go and buy some soft drinks"", if for instance you gave ten naira, we will take it uh... happily, collect it from you and pray for God to bless you and make you very wealthy."
That is how we do it here.
We don’t collect money.
"Anybody who comes here, we do our own services for them."
Thank God for today!
My name is Titi Ade.
I uh... I married...
"Some years ago, I married a soldier."
I live in the barracks.
We lived in the northern part of Nigeria before.
"We lived in Jos, we lived in Bauchi."
"From Bauchi to Jos, from Jos to Lagos."
"As we left Lagos, we came to Ibadan."
I am...
"My church which I'm going to is Mountain of Fire and Miracle Ministry, South West Two, Ojoo."
"Everything happening in Nigeria, everything is in God's hands."
Let's just leave everything to God.
"Because like our soldiers, they have killed a lot of them."
"Many of the women... many women in the barracks now, they are widows."
They don’t have of... husbands.
"Some of them, they are very young, some with one child, some with two children, and so on like that."
And we are still praying.
"May God just help us with the problem of Boko Haram which is killing our soldiers, and some innocent uh... people."
We are still praying.
May God just help us.
The Boko Haram problem is here.
We are... we...
Before that... uh... before the food shortages came again; children... there's no money to go to school.
"No school fees, no food."
We're just managing things.
"The things we bought last week, if you want to buy them today, you will buy it..."
"We, we, we..."
"If you bought it last week for two hundred naira, like today, if you want to buy it, they will say it is five hundred."
What are we in for?
"So it's only God, he's the one who will help us."
"Let's keep praying, and let's pray for our president."
May he... may he be well.
May he remain in good health.
Because they said he is... he is sick now.
We don’t know his condition.
May God let him get well again so that everything will go well for Nigeria.
So we thank God for everything.
We thank God.
"Because this nation we're in, if someone rules it today, we'll say he is the best."
"If another one comes in and we're happy he's come to power, we will be complaining."
"You will not bring up another sy-... uh... another... his own system which will make Nigeria... which, which will make everything harder for the people of Nigeria."
So may God just help us.
Because everything... we don’t know where we are going in Nigeria.
We just don’t know.
Look at the children now.
"They go to school, we borrow money from cooperatives!"
"We struggle, send the children mo-... uh... to school, they come back from... they graduate from university, but no employment."
"Nothing, nothing."
What are we in for?
"What do we, as Nigerians, want to do now?"
No good jobs.
Uh... no drugs in our hospitals.
"If you go to the hospitals now, when you are sick, you go to the hospital, the most effective drug on the list, is the one that will be... is the one that will be the most expensive."
"They will say, you should o-... no... go and buy it."
"Tomorrow, they'll say they're on strike."
"Uh... doctors, they're not working."
Sick people are in beds.
"No drugs, no treatment."
Another death will happen again.
So may God just help us.
Everything is fucked.
Nigeria is fucked.
It's fucked.
I just pity the new born children that we're giving birth to now.
Because we don’t understand their future.
"It's only God, he's the one who'll help us."
It's serious.
"Osas, your wedding you're preparing for, I... I'm looking forward to it."
"Uh... auntie, it's not easy."
This is seriously keeping me up at night.
"Me, I'm not worried because I'm just looking forward to that day so I can dance."
I can't even sleep.
"And as it is, me, I like my bride, the girl's so fine."
Hm.
"Her character, she and I just connected the first day I saw her."
That's how you just forgot your boy.
"Ah, I forgot my boy."
You've gotten a new daughter.
You don't see?
Uhuh!
"You didn't see the attraction is that since I've gotten my daughter now, it's the daughter that fills... rules the house."
There is no problem.
Toh!
"Because all of you, by the time you get married, you'll forget everything, but if I have a daughter I get along with, I can come to her house anytime."
"Auntie, I don't believe we'll forget home."
Don't disturb me.
Ah!
That's how men behave.
"When you've concentrated your wife... on your wife, you'll have forgotten everything."
How?
"No, no, no, no."
I've had brothers that haven't forgotten our home.
"They're still there, they're still in the house."
"Uhuh, but the truth is that when you look at what they're doing and what their wives do, their wives, they are stronger."
"Then, that's right."
"And you agree that the house, it's the woman that takes care of it, right?"
"Haha, that's it."
Yeah!
It's the woman that takes care of it.
You know... you'll just be there saying that it's you that's the head.
That's right.
"But auntie, that's not the issue."
The major issue is the wedding preparation.
Ah!
What preparation?
It's you... is it not you who wants to bring a wife to the house?
"Uh... sure I want to bring a wife to the house but, auntie, the thing uh... is feeding off my money."
"Ehe, so, it's you that will..."
It's good.
"Because when you know that something is precious, no matter the amount, it will not disturb you."
"As it is now, with the reccession, we don't even have the money, that's the problem."
"Aha, you don't have to use a lot of money."
Aha!
"Auntie, how can you tell me that I don't need to?"
You wanna come and eat?
I'll come and eat.
"Even if I don't eat, there is no problem."
People want to come and eat.
Uhuh!
What will you do?
Won't I provide food for them?
What's there?
Corn isn't easy.
Hm.
Just cook tuwo.
"Haha, tuwo will be plenty."
"Auntie, you go to market."
You know how much corn is in the market now.
I know!
Uhuh!
"And the thing is that, wu-... No matter how much you spend on the wedding, the truth is that people will still insist that they didn't get food to eat."
Uh... but there are major things that I need to do.
Then that's to say you're supposed to plan ahead.
"Auntie, even buying her wedding gown is money, getting my own suit is money."
"It's true, it's true."
There's food.
But you have an old suit?
You can take it to the dry cleaner.
Uhuh!
You know as women... you know how you are.
"If it's not your color, you won't agree."
I have black.
"Let me use black, she didn't agree."
"Uhuh, it's her day."
It has to.
"Alright, it's her day."
That's where the money issue will be involved.
"But you know that... but you know that the truth is that, if you look at our own culture closely, those things are not necessary."
I have to get the color.
As we have borrowed the white man's culture...
But the women will not agree.
Women will not agree.
You know what?
"If you change your mind now and say I don't have this and I'm not getting married, she will come back."
Uh... you think so auntie?
"Haha, yes now haha."
Haha.
I don't think... I don't think so.
Lit-...
Aha!
"If she really likes you, she will come."
"I don't think so, I don't think so."
She will come because...
"Oh, women always check that okay it's their day, they need to be happy that day."
Because...
Uhuh!
"So, just do what they want."
Uhuh!
But what color did she choose?
"She chose uh... royal blue, lilac and..."
I like that color.
No wonder she and I connected very well because royal blue is one of my favorite colors.
Royal blue is my color too.
"It's Chelsea, but I don't have a royal, royal blue suit."
I have to wear... I have to go and find it in the market.
Hm.
You can buy and sew it.
You don't have to buy an ori-... a ready-made.
"Ah, sewing will be more expensive auntie."
"Alright, ready made will be okay."
Even getting the material...
That's not a problem.
"I know when you talked about food, in this part of our culture, it's not just you that'll bring food that day."
"People will contribute, people will donate."
"The only thing is that you'll plan based on your own budget so that if they add to it, it's an addition."
"Alright, auntie, so far as it is, nobody is bringing anything."
They will.
"When the time is close, you will see."
When?
You'll see.
"This, we are talking um... about a month's time."
"Me, I'm telling you that my wedding uh... my family just left me to do whatever I wanted."
"Two weeks before the wedding, that was when they made up their mind."
"Because there was a time that I said please no, I don't want visitors; no, I don't want cards; no, it's only three people; it's only ten people."
They didn't say a thing to me.
"It was two weeks before the wedding that my sister said look, this wedding is not your own, it's the whole family's."
"Because, in our own culture, a wedding is not just for you, it's for the family."
"Because people that don't know you will come because they know your mother, they know your sister, they know your brother, they know your uncle."
All these people will come for that wedding.
"Her own family too, it's the same thing."
"So, they will say, ""this wedding is not just for you."""
They'll just let you do what you want to do.
"When you get to that stage, when you stop, they will add."
Ah!
"And the truth about a wedding is what you don't have, don't go and borrow."
"Auntie, I don't want to depend on that."
I know that people will...
"No, I didn't say you will depend on that."
Plan according to your budget.
What they will bring is an addition.
"That's right, that's right."
I know that it's difficult.
X.
It's not easy.
"I'll tell you that man, this thing is keeping me up at night."
By the time X.
X.
"Don't worry, haha."
"Two AM, that's when I'll just wake up and be thinking, thinking what... what I have not set on the ground and what I have not set on..."
"As in, the thing is making me feel like I haven't even done anything."
About everything that I've done.
I have advised you to make a checklist.
I will still...
"I have, auntie."
Hm.
I have the checkli-... uh... check uh... this thing... list.
"If I'm sleeping, I'll just wake up and be feeling like okay, there is something I didn't write on this list."
It's the joy.
"So that they... after the wedding, you'll just say, ""is that it?"""
Hm.
"Auntie, I like to sleep."
Haha
"Anything that will disturb my sleep, I don't like it."
"For my kind of mechanic, for instance, when you call me to say your car broke down on the road, first I'll come with my plier and screwdriver."
"When I get there, first of all, I'll check ""do you have fuel in the car?"""
"If there's fuel in your car, I'll ask, ""before the car broke down, the mo-... will, will... did the car show any signs?"""
"""Yes or no?"""
"If you give me an answer, I'll know what to do based on your response."
"If, if the car gave you some signs... maybe you can tell me that the car was jerking."
I will just say it's the fuel pump.
Mstchew!
"From there, I'll look inside your car, open the seats at the back, loosen the... where the pump is and bring it out and fix it."
"In some cars, becoming..."
The fuel pump is underneath.
"Until I remove the tank, bring it out, loosen it and wash the... this, this thing, then I will come and tell you that you should give me some money since... so that I can go to the... buy some at the fuel pump."
"When you call to tell me that your car is jerking... the car is jerking, jerking, jerking, first I'll come and loosen your car's plug."
The plug is in the middle of the engine.
It's inside the top cylinder.
I'll loosen it.
Some of the plugs use sixteen while some use twenty one.
"I'll loosen it, and the, the plug ignites the car's engine."
It powers up the car when the fuel circulates under the top cylinder.
The piston starts taking the fuel up while the plug powers it up.
"At the same time, there's a certain fire in the middle of the engine which we call the breaking fire."
Now the engine is getting hot.
"If you put your hand under the car, you can feel that the engine is hot."
"And when you call to tell me that you... your feels like it's full when you are driving, I know that can only be the shaft, or the tie rod."
"I pick up my tools, go there and take off the shaft, fix it, buy grease and some, some parts for the materials."
"I will come and fix it, buy hosing, and the rest."
"And when you call me to say your car... you know what's wrong with your car, you hear something... a sound when you're moving, I will come to you."
"You bring your car here, I'll take the jack, raise up the side where the noise is coming from."
"If you raise up the side, then I will check, check, check, check."
"Maybe there's a plate, or something wrong has broken, or something that, that has gone wrong."
"So from there, I'll tell you what is wrong with your car."
"And then, you will give me money to go and buy the parts I will need."
"And when you call to tell me your car just... you kicked the car but it refused to start, there are two things."
"Either the battery, or the key starter."
"Either the key starter, or the battery."
When you call me...
Or fuel.
"Sorry, three things."
Or fuel.
"From there, we will figure out how to handle the issue."
"When you call me to say your car is overheating when you're moving, you noticed that your car got hot, I only know that maybe your fan is not working, maybe the gasket of your car's top cylinder's has burnt, maybe the temperature switch is not set."
Something like that.
"Or when you call me to say your car is acting up, it doesn't idle smoothly... if it uses a carburetor, I'll say I'll loosen the carburetor and service it."
"Or if it is an injector, I will loosen the injector, buy."
There's something we call carburetor cleaner.
"I will buy it, and come and..."
"That stuff, it cleans out the dirt which is in the dust inside."
"It cleans it, and all that."
And when you say you just came...
"Imagine you just came here and said, ""hey, here's my car!"""
It's just acting up.
I was... I was driving and it's just acting up.
You don't know what's wrong.
"Just heard the sound puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh."
"If I go there, if you load your gear, maybe, it's that the engine seat (mount) is worn out, or the engine is not... is not set right, or the idling, or something like that."
There are a lot of things about the mechanics' job that if you come and tell me that your car has a problem...
"You see, when I wanted to start this thing, well, a friend talked me into it."
He said I should buy this thing.
This thing is good.
"Well, at the time he asked me to buy it, I didn't have any money."
Then he caught one and he said he should give it to me.
I said... he said w-... I should go and put it in my house.
I did what he said.
God provided money and I bought a male.
Then I put it in.
They started giving me eggs.
Like...
"They gave me eggs, like eight eggs."
"They gave me more, like three."
It remains...
It laid ten eggs.
"This one, that's the one."
"Again, I was... little by little."
I'm fine.
"A dog that was in this house, it ate two of my turkeys."
"I was sleeping, then I started hearing them fight violently."
I came outside.
"I saw the dog, it ran that way."
I went after it but I did not catch it.
"The one it actually came to eat, I bought them for four thousand each."
"The male... the male, I bought it for seven thousand."
"Well, it ate it."
"The one that eventually died, she gave me four eggs."
Then I added the eggs to that one.
Well.
"If they want to hatch the eggs, they will sit on the eggs for around thirty five days."
Well.
"Now, they are done brooding."
"This one here, she hatched her eggs."
She hatched ten of her eggs.
"Well, I don't have money, so I s-... sold them for five hundred naira each."
I sold nine.
Well.
"Eventually now, yesterday, I came back in the night and I saw this one."
They have moved... given me chicks.
So I caged them up and I went out to buy them food.
Then I fed them.
Uh... the food uh... this is the food.
The food.
"Food, right?"
Right!
That's the food.
"Now, by the time I got back, I had just two hundred [naira] with me."
I went for one hundred naira's worth.
"I gave the, the big one, I served it to them."
"And then, I went out to buy a Fitila lantern."
And I put it there.
"<hau> Shi, ke nan <hau>."
Eh.
"They eat rice, Indomie, like rice pudding, yams, bread."
"Now, if I get... if I buy two... three fifty naira's worth of loaves of bread, they'll eat it."
"Quickly, now, now, now."
That's if it's in the daytime.
"Right now, I have bread, which I have come to give, give them."
"Or should I take the bread, right."
"Should I bring it, so you see it, well."
"They are over there, living off me."
"If I have money, they will eat meals worth five hundred, courtesy of me."
No problem.
"If sometimes I don't have money, they will... they will be calm."
"Well, did you see?"
Yes.
They're a kind of security.
"Now, if you come in... if you come in the house, it will be making sounds like kwulukwulukwuluu."
Kwulukwulukwuluu.
Kwulukwulukwuluu.
Why won't I report it?
"Well, did you see?"
Now if I...
"Even if I am not around, if you come in, it will be doing this."
"Even the people outside, they will come in."
"Look, what is wrong with the, th-... this thing?"
Correct!
Did you see?
"If they see a snake, they will kill it."
"If they see a snake, they will kill it."
"Even though rats, they come out, they will go after it, and kill it."
"Now if they are sleeping, look at the place where they kill it, that veranda."
Correct!
Rain does not bother them at all.
"As long as this thing on their heads has been finished, the rain doesn't disturb them in any way."
"Now myself, I don't have a cage at the moment."
It's outside they sleep.
"Now this one, it's inside the room I will keep it."
Correct!
<hau> Ah gaskiya dai! <hau>
"Ah, the meat is delicious!"
"Honestly, the meat is delicious."
"Now you see this one, if I want to sell it, I'll get around seven thousand, or eigth thousand."
"If it's during the Christmas season, well, I can get around ten thousand."
But uh... the female... it won't be more than four thousand... three thousand five hundred.
"Well, but it's the male..."
The male is very big.
"Correct, they don't like the female."
They like the male very much.
"If they want to eat over there, the, the male has so much meat."
"This one, no meat."
"Now, I have six."
Six uh... with that one.
The dog has eaten one.
The dog has eaten one.
Why won't I report it?
I won't tell them so they might pay me.
I just forgot about it.
"Okay, my name is Bassey."
People call me Skata.
"Um... I like to drink uh... beer, but not all beers."
"I like to drink uh... Stout, but today, I just decided to drink uh... Gulder."
"We have uh... Stout, we have Gulder, we have uh... Origin, we have uh... Star, we have uh... different brands of beer."
But I like drinking Stout because...
"The, the reason I like drinking Stout is because Stout doesn't..."
"When you drink Stout, you don't need to go piss, piss all the time."
Because... and it will also keep your belly full.
"If you want to go a long way, you don't need to go to the bathroom every now and then."
Stout will keep your belly nice and full.
That's why I like Stout.
But uh... many people prefer the other brands as well.
And I like to come to this uh... place because their drinks are not expensive.
You will go to some places and they will tell you the Stout is four fifty a bottle... five hundred.
"But in this place, you can buy it for three thou-... three hundred and fifty naira here, and drink."
"And beer also, though it's good, it's not very good for young people... for children."
Someone who has... who is not uh... eighteen years or older yet is not supposed to be drinking beer.
"Because if they start drinking beer, it will affect them negatively."
They won't behave well at home.
"Even in school, they won't concentrate."
So it's good for someone to be over eighteen before they can start drinking uh... beer.
But beer is very good because it will help you.
It will make you know... I mean feel bold.
It will make you feel bold at all times.
"Apart from that, I also come in here to eat, most of the times because here, their food is good."
It's uh... hygenic.
It's clean.
They prepare it... they cook it the way everybody likes it.
They are from Calabar.
"As we all know, Calabar people are the ones who know the most about how to cook."
So I always come here to eat with them.
"They have... they've got edikaikon here, they have epankwokwo, the have garri (eba), and soup; they have uh..."
"About the soup, they have uh... afiaifere, ebot; they have uh... otong, they have uh... ogkuoafan, they have uh..."
"At times, they also have diedesi here, they have iwuhabia, they have ozobuko."
"In fact, they have all kinds of food here."
They also have pepper soup.
"They have uh... cowtail pepper soup, they have fish pepper soup too."
So everything is here.
They have everything someone can eat and enjoy here.
"Uh... myself, most of the times... a lot of the time when I come here, I, I like to eat afiafherebo, yeah, and auzomahbiah."
"For auzomahbiah, they prepare it with uh... yam."
They pound the yam.
The whites call it pounded yam.
"But with afihafereboh, they add uh... goat meat in it, and they prepare it in such a way that they don't put any..."
They cook it in the... in the way where they don't add vegetable leaves to it.
The soup is peer... pure white.
Just white like that.
I have finished now.
"This is a very short story that's coming your way on ninety five point one, Wazobia FM on this fifth day in June twenty seventeen."
"Alright, listen carefully so you can hear the big news."
"Yesterday, the Federal Government said they will not hesitate to expose people whose work is... whose work is to spread fake news all over the country."
And they will bring them to justice.
"The Senate president, Doctor Bukola Saraki, announced to the house that it will not be appropriate for the politicians who are currently in office to abandon their offices and duties in pursuit of victory in the upcoming twenty nineteen elections."
"The Senator representing Ogun East, Buruji Kashamu, said he's not happy at all that Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, is saying that President Mohammadu Buhari should drop his letter of resignation."
"The National Assembly has declared that it's not possible... that the Senate has nothing to do with the story circulating around that the pump price of petrol will increse in... by five naira, saying they did not even discuss anything like that."
"The Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello's name has, like magic, disappeared from the voters register after he was accused of registering twice."
"The House of Representatives has given the Controller General of Nigeria Immigration Service, also known as NIS, Muhamed Babandele, uh... till Wednesday to appear in the... before them or they will employ force again him."
"The Federal Inland Revenue Service, also known as FR-... FRIS, has released what they call the six key electronic solution, also known as e-services, so as to make it easy for people to pay their taxes."
"The Chief Justice of Nigeria... of Nigerian, also known as NJC, Justice Walter Onnoghen, has announced the appointment of Mrs Had-... Hadizatu Uwani Mustapha as the Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court."
"The Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission, also known as LASIEC, has received the list of candidates for the All Progressive Congress, APC, to run for the seats of the Chairman and councillors in next month's Local Government election."
"Bad guys, robbers, have gone to the great beyond."
A bank agent withdrew two million naira from his account for the four Local Government areas in Ogun State.
In the white man's country.
Twelve people have been arrested by the Police for their involvement in the terror attack that occurred in London.
For buying and selling.
"The way the Nigerian nai-... naira is appreciating these days will ensure that the Central Bank of Nigeria, also known as CBN, continues to monitor the financial market, which will encourage better results."
"In entertainment news, our Nigerian rapper, Eva Alordiah..."
My name is Edewoh.
Or the way it's called in my... in my area is Edewo.
Because uh... I'm a Delta boy; I'm Urhobo.
"And uh... I come from a family of six, and I'm the fourth born, actually"
"But initally uh... while growing up, because it's... it's... it's... I was born in Lagos, you know, my mom and dad... we speak English there, mostly, because they wan-..."
The whole idea of...
"To know a kid who, who's educated, they're supposed to speak English really well."
So they started from when they were little.
"English was the language they used... they, they... that they spoke to us in."
"So, it also has its down sides because here as we speak, I can't speak my language."
"Haha, something like that."
It's more like that.
"And I... (you know then), I associated with people as I grew up, and I realized that people speak different languages."
"It... it's like I'm an outcast in Lagos, where I stay."
"You know, people speak different languages."
"I figured, ""ah, everyone's supposed to be speaking English."""
"""What language is this Pidgin that people are speaking?"""
"You know, so I started picking it up little by little, I started to learn to speak it little by little, but uh... you know that every time you go back to the house, you'll be expected to speak English."
So I couldn’t master the language.
"You know, so, I started..."
"You know be-... um... because I used to act, I used to work at another radio station before, before I came to... before I came to Wazobia, so since I resumed in Wazobia, it's more like..."
"Okay then, since they, they employed me to speak English on Cool TV, because at that time... we had Cool TV at that time, so was I hired to speak English."
As d-... I... as I...
"I still remember the way I perfomed in the audition, where, where my MD said, ""now, speak Pidgin so we can hear how it'll sound."""
That’s how I started.
"He said no, no, no, no, no, no."
I should speak English because it's like my spoken English is better.
"I said, ""ah, there's a problem."""
"He said, ""no, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry!"""
He said that my spoken English was alright.
I should just stick to speaking English.
"You know but as time went on, they hired me here, you know."
So I started working.
"We were broadcasting in English, we were... we were... we, we were broadcasting in Pidgin."
"Then, uh... there were some logistical issues, there were some technical issues."
So we merged Cool TV into Wa-... Wazobia.
"Then, everybody had to speak Pidgin."
"Me, I started wondering, ""ah, the Pidgin language I've been running away from has caught up to me right here!"""
"That’s how I started, and I'm still here, and I'm growing."
Then I re-... uh... I realized that Pidgin is not a language that's meant for people who don't sa-... who aren't uh... intelligent.
"It's for Nigerians who wanna communicate, who wanna reach as many people as possible."
"Because since I don't speak my language now, I'm sure that if I go to Sapele, or Delta and I speak Pidgin, I'll be able to communicate with the people over there; but if I speak English, they'll be looking at me like, ""ah, buddy, you should know that we don't speak that language here."""
"""We speak Uhrobo."""
"""Why don't you speak the language we understand?"""
You know.
"So... but I realized that Pidgin... anywhere I go... (because I can say that I've been to as many as eighteen States in this country), and everywhere I go, Pidgin paves the way for me."
"Even if it's not the same type of Pidgin they speak in Warri, but it's the one of I-... I-... Ibadan or it's the one of Abuja, you will realise that if you speak any kind of Pidgin, it works."
"People will still understand you, um... uh... what you're saying."
"So that's why I appreciate this platform because since I've been here, I haven't been lost."
Because if I s-... if I get to a place where I'm expected to just speak English... I'm expected to be speaking... I'll be able to speak it and get along.
"If I get to where I need to communicate with people (you know), where I have never been to before... if I want to go to a new place, I'll just be speaking Pidgin."
So I started building up my vocabulary... I started building it up.
"Yes, I realized that even right here, we were... we, we, we treated Pidgin like an, an international language."
People will be...
"Because myself, I, I organize shows where I... I... I... I go on the Red Carpet; I interview people."
"So I'll dress really well, dress co-... in a fashionable way; in an official way; put on suits, everything."
"And people will recognize my presence, saying ""okay, he's from Wazobia, okay""."
"I want to tell the person, ""we speak Pidgin, hope you don't mind."""
"They'll say, ""oh, we'll be speaking Pidgin?"""
I say yes.
"They'll say uh... uh... you know, ""oh yeah? But you know I don’t speak Pidgin very well."""
"I say, ""Ma'am, you're a Nigerian, right?"""
"""You'll speak this language."""
"They said, ""alright, alright, alright, let's try it out, let's try it out."""
"And (so far so good), it's like anytime people see me on the Red Carpet, they'll want me to interview them because they know that this guy will want to speak Pidgin, not in English which we'll be struggling to speak."
We'll just be free.
"We'll relate so well, you know."
"So from here, the thing started to build up."
There was awareness.
"Everywhere we go, they say, ""ah, it's wo-... Wazobia."""
You speak the best Pidgin.
That’s your work.
"You know, so it started building up its own uh... level of acceptance, across... everywhere."
"There's no event we attend, even if the Pre-... President will be coming..."
You know I... there was a day I... that I interviewed the Minister of Information.
That's uh... Lai Muhammed.
"And he, he, he, he, he was asking me ""how far now? So, how will it go?"""
"I, I said, ""No Sir, we speak Pidgin here."""
"He said uh... ""ah, alright, let's do it now, we are Nigerians, this is our language."""
So we started speaking.
"So pi-... people who interviewed him before me saw us laughing, cracking jokes, laughing... ah."
"So they were wondering what I was telling him that, that was making him laugh so much... that was making the old man laugh so much."
What was I telling him?
"I said ""ah!"""
"Then I realized that, wow, this Pidgin brought us together."
We finished the interview.
"He shook my hand and he said, ""well done, young man; this is good, this one is... this is Nigerian."""
"I said, ""yes sir, we’re doing our best, we’re doing our best."""
"So that’s the platform that uh... Wazobia has created for us, which made us realize that Pidgin English isn't just the language of the uneducated."
"It's not a language that, that people that are..."
"Because they say it's for the people on the streets, it's for uh... the riffraff."
They're the ones who speak Pidgin.
But then you realize that it’s the only language that cuts across Nigeria without any issues.
Yo can go anywhere now if you... if you note... if there...
"Some time... some time ago, when I... when I went to SA, I w-... I went to South Africa, and I was just... because it's... it's English, we believe everybody will understand."
"But when I was there, I went into a mall and I saw a black guy."
"Me and the guy, we were just chatting in Pidgin because we want... we didn't want... we didn't, didn't want anybody else hear what we were saying."
"We were just talking in Pidgin, so the man asked me, ""ah, man, how far? Are you a Nigerian?"""
"I said, ""oh, you understand, right?"""
Yes.
"I said, ""good, good, yeah, I'm Nigerian."""
"He said he himself is Nigerian, but he's been here for almost twelve years."
"I said, ""aha, hope you are... will you be coming back to Nigeria?"""
"So I said... he said he comes back every year, but he is w-... uh... working in South Africa."
"I said ""ah, good, good!"""
"So I realised that Pidgin, on its own, has gotten to a level where..."
"But I, I know that if, if, if given a little time now, it can get to the level where French uh... where English can be above it."
"You know, it will create its own..."
"Because as it is, the Ghanaians have their own version of Pidgin, Nigerians have their own version of Pidgin, the people at Cotonou have theirs too."
"You know, in the different countries... in the West African countries, they have their own different versions of Pidgin."
"So we know that with time, it'll grow."
"With time, it, it, it's growing."
"So, well, basically, as... with the shows I organize, which give me the opportunity to interact with people every day, which take me to events in order to interview them... it's mostly in Pidgin."
"Even if I have a white guy on the Red Carpet, I'll tell him, ""hey man, we speak Pigdin here in Nigeria, will you like to try it?"""
"He'll say, ""let's do this, let's do this"", and he'll try to speak the language as best he can because he himself wants to identify with the, the language."
"So that's, that’s the basic thing we, we do."
"Okay, ladies and gentlemen, don't let this turn into a quarrel."
"Today is Monday, and uh... we're already moving to the different departmental behaviors."
"Uh... they say a bird in hand, is worth uh... so many b-... so many millions in the bush."
But I'm saying that it's the bird in the hand that's the real bird.
"To avoid stories that touch the heart, ""I was there"", and ""I shall be there"" are two different things."
Are you with me?
Okay!
"Frankly speaking, you see, uh... if, if you... when we... when we look like at life generally, we know that uh... someone is talking."
"Your words, right, are different from people... other, other people's words."
"And if you... if you want to equate your words with other people's words, it'll drive you crazy."
"You alone will go crazy, you alone will be disgraced and you alone will destroy your authencity as a spoilt brat."
That's it.
Don't let it turn into a quarrel.
That's worse.
I was there and I shall be there are two different things.
Yes!
"My mom's tummy is big and my mother is pregnant are two different things, to avoid stories that touch the heart."
"What it is, we don’t know yet."
So that's how things stand.
"Well, the Professor has spoken."
The discussiont goes on.
"In fact, what are we saying?"
I don't even know.
I'm just speaking my mind.
"You understand, I'm just baring my mind, you understand."
People are just looking at me and they're wondering what I'm talking about.
But all talk is about conversation.
"So as to not waste time, because if you say yours, I say mine."
"All together, we call it a conversation."
Are you listening to me?
Many words are called multiple words.
That’s how it is.
Yes!
"Um... uh... there's a saying goes ""before you shoot a bird, will you get its mother to fly away?"""
"Just hold the mother and the child together, lock them somewhere and give them food to eat."
They'll cooperate with you at once.
Yes!
What do I want to say again?
"Myself, I've forgotten."
Okay.
I'm MC Abi.
"I'm a comedian, and we are saying so many things uh... on the language issue."
Uh... we are... we have different ways of referring to our father.
"We call them 'pile', we call them uh... uh... 'pupsie', we call him 'old man'."
"So one day, we got together and were praying for God to bless me!"
"It was, ""God bless me."""
So I was praying for God to change my life!
"And eventually, God changed my life!"
"My brother, then my prayer changed."
"I got to the house and I was praying, ""Father, crucify my old man... crucify my old man."""
That was how I prayed.
I didn't know that I was ta-... talking about my own flesh.
"But my father heard me praying, and he thought I was talking about him."
"""Crucify my old man... crucify my old man."""
And so my pi-... my dad took his gun.
"He pointed the gun at me saying, ""You want to kill me, but instead, I'll be the first person to kill you in this town."""
"My brother, I spent two weeks in the hospital, with POP [Plaster of Paris] on my neck."
"Limit my diction, limit my..."
"Furthermore, my, my speech became really distorted."
"So, I was like that, and I let the issue rest."
"Then, I graduated to the next point of expressional dimensional overture."
What did I say?
I don't know yet.
That's it.
"I'm hustling, that's it."
"MC Abi, that's my name, do not forget."
I'm here for your sake.
Yes!
"Okay, the show I'm featuring on here is tagged, ""On a Lighter Note with MC Abi."""
We're talking about so many things happening in society from uh... or from different perspectives.
We're looking at life from the funny angles so that people won't be depressed.
You're always walking about with your arms up as if your have boils in your armpits.
"You know, your... you will calm down."
You won't...
"You know, you won't just squeeze your face like... as if your look reminds people of scarcity or austerity, or that people are on strike."
No!
We want us to be... everyone to calm down.
There's enough problems around already.
"If you're having hot pepper soup while the weather is hot, you just want to make things worse."
Yes!
So what?
"Everybody is trying to calm down, enjoy the groove, and enjoy what we are saying."
"We talk about lots of things: fashion, life, general trending issues (you know), post... plus political matters... everything, you know."
We're just talking about it all.
"So those are the things we talk about on the show known as ""On a Lighter Note with MC Abi"" and every day comes with its own gist."
"For example, today is Proverbial, Proverbial Monday."
"We talk about different proverbs, explaining them with real life issues."
We will tell you a proverb when people are...
"When you hear it, naturaly, it is... it has a meaning, but we attach humor to it."
But they'll tell you that the downfall of a man is not the... not... it's not the end of his life.
I say it's a lie.
It depends on where the man falls from.
"Yes, because if the man falls from a tall... a very high building, and hits the ground, that means he's dead."
"That's... that's also known as ""Call to Glory."""
"You are on your own, by yourself and with yourself."
"Yes, and on Tuesdays, we do trendy things, those things in vogue, you know, the things going on in town, in your neighborhood (you know), what's the... what, what happens to be the new thing, the new level... the rave of the moment."
"Then on Wednesdays, we talk about relationships, love matters, you know, you know..."
"You know, this issue of ""I love you, I love you."""
It looks... it’s turning into something else.
"The last time I was told that... when a chick told me, ""okay, if you know you really love me, would you die for me?"", I warned her."
"I said, ""if you try it with me!"""
"""How will I die for you?"""
"""Don't you know that the love I have for you is an undying love?"""
That's my escape route.
Because I can't die for anyone.
Yes!
"So on Wednesdays... I mean Thursdays, we talk about past events which happened many years ago, in those days when we were... when we were really living, and we compare it to what we have now."
"Like the poems we recite in those days, when we were in school; our poems are different from what they have now."
"We recited poems like 'your canoe is out of shape, our canoe is in shape...'"
Those were the kinds of poem we used to sing.
"You know, a bonga, a bonga... we don't know it."
"But nowadays, all those children... their... the package... it doesn’t work out well."
"So we do... we compare the things of those days with the things of, of... (you know), now... nowadays."
"How we go to school in those days... we put our slates under our armpits, we take..."
"Our slates were our... they were our modern-day day iPad, or tablet that we use now."
It's the slate.
We call it a blackboard.
A small one.
We wrote our ABCs and 123s on them.
We held them under our armpits and took them to school.
"You know, we went schools for the sake of eating akara [bean cake] at that time."
That's the nursery schoool.
"You know, different things."
We took water bottles with us.
"All of us will drink with the same cup, from a big drum, at the long break period."
No.
For those long...
Then we'd go... we'd drop one kobo each into a bowl to eat bread and akara.
That was how we hustled back then.
I was in school at that time.
"Then, l was asked to read the letters of the alphabet."
I sang the ABCs.
Then I got to a part in the song...
M U M E O P.
"Ah, that was how I understood it."
So I took spu-... that was how I recited it.
I said M U M E scopew.
U R O skecity.
"I said, ""stop there!"""
"""Come and touch scopew on the board!"""
I told the teacher that I was f-... I was sick.
"Mama said if I'm sick, I shouldn't touch anything on the board."
That was how I escaped in school.
There were different things which helped in training us in schools.
Confusion.
Confusion.
The teacher gave me math and English exercises.
I failed.
"I was provoked, and I went out to call my 'mile'."
Mile is another name for mom in Warri.
"I went out to call my mom, and I told her, ""come and see!"""
"Out of all the students in this school, they beat me saying that I don’t understand math and English."
My mom showed up.
A typical Urhobo woman.
She warned the teacher.
"""Teacher, you whipped my child."""
He said yes.
Uhuh?
"She said ""okay, why did you whip him?"""
"The teacher said, ""because I gave him exercises in math and English, and he failed."""
The teacher said...
"My mom said, ""do you even understand math?"""
"The teacher said, ""of course, I'm the teacher."""
"My mum said ""okay, if you understand math, then solve this one for me."""
Mom mom gave the teacher a tough math exercise.
She said okay!
Some went to this place and some went to the other place.
How many remained?
"For two minutes, the teacher was confused."
"The teacher said, ""lady, this isn't math."""
"My mum said, ""come on, keep quiet!"""
"""You don't know that this is a simple math exercise."""
"""If some went to this place, and some went another other place, only some will remain?"""
Oh boy!
"For, for the next five uh... four years in school, the, the teacher didn't lay a finger on me."
"If you dare raise a cane up to beat me, I'll just say that I'll get my mom to come after you."
I threatened the whole school with the news of my mom coming.
That was how I continued till I left... finished my primary school education.
So don't forget that.
"(You know), we picked different things from our neighborhood."
Neighborhood... our neighborhood raised us.
You know that a frog's eye... you get things done because you're smart.
Not because you are the general overseer.
You don't understand?
Uh... people say that the monkey got smart because the trees are closely connected.
"If the trees are far apart, you'll see that monkeys will go under, buy pure water, board a motorcycle, and use a handkerchief because the weather is hot [meaning that the monkey will apply wisdom]."
Do you understand?
"Don't let it cause a quarrel, my brothers and sisters, understand!"
That means I have been speaking with you.
The conversation continues.
Kanapotelli zaga za.
What does that mean?
I dunno.
I don't even want to know.
Get out!
Your father!
"""Your father"" is a greeting."
It's not a curse!
Thank you!
